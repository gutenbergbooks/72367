<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> historical portions of this novel will be found
to differ considerably from generally accepted
versions of the events related. The prime
sources utilized are both contemporary, both French, and
both untranslated; namely, the diary of Sieur Baudouin,
once a soldier and later chaplain under Iberville, and the
amazing “Histoire de l’Amérique Septentrionale” of
Bacqueville de la Potherie.</p>

<p>The former work, furnished me in MS. by kindness of
the Newfoundland Historical Society, yielded full details
regarding the Newfoundland raid. In abridged form,
it was utilized by Sieur Bacqueville, whose work is
astounding because of its remarkably distinct, yet wildly
confused, combination of sources. A letter from the
missionary Bobé, himself a student and memorialist of
Canadian affairs, has informed us of Sieur Bacqueville’s
great exactitude. He had a share in much that he described;
for the remainder, he drew by document or
word of mouth on Baudouin, Perrot, the Le Moynes,
Joliet and the Jesuits. The manner in which these sources
can be traced through the internal evidence of his work
is most interesting; the work itself cannot be translated
satisfactorily, owing to its disregard of historical sequence
and its jumble of unrelated documents and dictation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>In places, however, it is remarkably clear, and has
been followed for the Hudson Bay events. I do not attempt
to account for the extraordinary discrepancies
which exist between these events as herein set forth and
as related by A. C. Laut in “The Conquest of the Great
Northwest.” This discrepancy exists in nearly every
detail and is almost incredible, since the latter work
quotes Bacqueville as an authority. The same discrepancy
exists between its account of Iberville’s earlier exploits
on the bay and that which Iberville himself presumably
furnished Sieur Bacqueville. The two versions
are totally different. I have followed the 1753 edition
of the Histoire, which was a careful reprint of the second
edition of 1722. I believe that no copies are known
to exist of the first edition, of 1716. Miss Laut quotes
a much later edition. Perhaps that is why her account
is so astonishing—as, for example, making one of Iberville’s
ships, the <i>Violent</i>, founder in the straits, when this
ship was not even with his squadron; and when we are
expressly told that it was a small brigantine named the
<i>Esquimeau</i> which went down. Nor is this the most amazing
error in the volume named.</p>

<p>But now let me cry “peccavi!” on my own account.
Iberville was not with Bienville at the Bay de Verde
burning, although I put him there. I have purposely
ignored the fact that Serigny was blown into the Danish
river on his way to Nelson; and I have no authority for
bringing poor Moon there—though where he did go I
have been unable to discover, as he dropped from sight
between the straits and Nelson.</p>

<p>By introducing the <i>Albemarle</i> as Deakin’s ship, I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[vii]</span>
tried to resolve what was to me a sore problem—perhaps
for lack of any authoritative English account of the bay
action. After the capture of Nelson our friend Aide-major
Charles Claude le Roy—otherwise Sieur de
Bacqueville de la Potherie—loaded the looted furs and
the prisoners aboard a ship of this name and promptly
lost her on the shallows of the river-mouth. I find no
other mention of such a ship; no <i>Albemarle</i> formed a
part of either Fletcher’s or Iberville’s squadron. Since
all the furs and prisoners were put aboard her, she must
have been a vessel of goodly size and not a mere sloop
belonging to the forts.</p>

<p>Despite the dictum of learned persons that the term
“Canadian” is not found prior to the end of the eighteenth
century, I have used it advisedly. In De Beaudoncourt’s
“History of Canada,” based on French and American
documents, occurs this note:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Ce mot de <i>Canada</i> ou <i>Canata</i> veut dire, en langue du
pais, royaume des cabanes. Il a survécu à tous les autres,
il est avec celui de Montréal le seul datant de l’époque de
Jacques Cartier.”</p>
</div>

<p>The term Canadian is constantly used by Bacqueville
and by Baudouin; a statement by the latter infers that
it was likewise employed by the English to differentiate
the born Canadians from the French proper. The entire
history of North America at this period is largely
written in names of Canadian families; as though the
terrific struggle of the French pioneers against man and
nature had aroused in the ensuing generation all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
dormant blood of knightly and heroic ancestry, so that
the same names etched in the icy annals of Hudson Bay
are to be found burned into the cypress of Louisiana.</p>

THE MAN AND THE STAR</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Crawford</span> snuffed the candle on the table beside
him, turned the page of his book, and went on
reading; he felt the loneliness of Pentagoet. In
the wide hearth crackled a new-laid fire. Outside, the
trees groaned frostily, snapping in the night wind.</p>

<p>The room showed an amazing mixture of civilized
culture and savage magnificence. Candle-tray and
snuffers were of chased silver, beside the wine bottle on
the table was a heavy gold chalice, above the fireplace
hung crossed Toledo blades, and books shone brown in
a corner case. The light flickered on a careless pile of
beaver and elk-skins in one corner. Other skins strewed
the walls, mingled with belts and “arms” of wampum or
beadwork. A rack on the mantel held several pipes, all
of Indian make; one was a large calumet of white stone
girded with silver, a pipe heavy with fate not yet fulfilled,
and affecting lives of men. A tomahawk on the mantel
had a string of black wampum about the handle, several
dried scalps woven in among the wampum shells.</p>

<p>So much for the room. The man presented that same
singular combination of savagery and refinement. His
face was long and thinly chiselled, his eyes wide and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
heavy-lidded, his mouth large, humorous, dangerous. He
was of medium height; in the firelight his hair shone
reddish, and lines of hardship touched his face with stern
self-mastery. A beaver coat wrapped him to the waist.
Against stiff buckskin nether garments stood out a
sheathed knife and a slender, deadly tomahawk; beaded
ceremonial moccasins, far too large for him, encased his
feet. Before the blazing fire were drying his own moccasins,
stuffed out with rags, still steaming as if soaked
with wet snow or water. His hands, resting on book and
table, were large and powerful, the wrists showing half-healed
scars of manacles.</p>

<p>Crawford put out a hand to the pipe beside him,
filled it with kinnikinnick from the bag, held it above the
candle. He relaxed again in his chair, puffing, but his
eyes went to the door and then he took the pipe from his
mouth, listening. Those eyes of his were startling in
their alertness—light-blue eyes that fairly stabbed. His
wide lips smiled, as if at his own alarm.</p>

<p>“The shore ice grinding, that’s all,” he murmured.
“Folly to feel nervous here! I wish that Micmac rascal
would bring the cold pasty he promised me. Wine on a
stomach that has seen no food in two days is a hollow
mockery.”</p>

<p>Rising, Crawford crossed to the door and swung it
open.</p>

<p>He stood for a moment on the threshold, staring out
at the night. Stars blazed in the dark sky. A dozen
feet outside the house ran the black line of a palisade,
broken by an open gate directly in front of the doorway.
From where he stood, Crawford could see the abandoned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
lines of old Fort Pentagoet to one side, and beyond this
the long white line of the ice-rimmed shore; Penobscot
Bay was not frozen over, and the dark swishing of waves
mingled with the creaky whine of trees and the grind
of ice.</p>

<p>“A lonely place for a baron of France!” said Crawford,
puffing at his pipe. “Yet I wish he were here, with
his Indian wives and his henchmen. Fiend take this
solitude! I’ve had enough of it. Why couldn’t he leave
more than one solitary Micmac on the place?”</p>

<p>He shivered, turned, closed the door, and went back
to his chair. He took his book and opened it—then his
head lifted and he looked again at the door. He caught
a new sound, the scrape of a stiff moccasin, a low groan,
the fumble of stiff fingers at the latch. The door swung
open.</p>

<p>Into the room came an Indian, wrapped in furs, holding
in both hands a great silver dish. He advanced a
step into the room, kicked the door shut, stood motionless.
While Crawford stared at him, a frightful expression
of horror leaped across his brown face—then the
dish fell from his hands, he pitched forward, lay outstretched.
The long shagreen handle of a knife stood
out from between his shoulder-blades. The knife must
have caught him an instant before he opened the door.</p>

<p>Crawford sat motionless. For a long instant the thing
seemed incredible, uncanny, supernatural. He knew that
except for this Micmac and himself, the establishment
of Baron de Saint-Castin at the head of Penobscot Bay
was temporarily deserted. No war-parties were afoot
hereabouts; the year 1697 had opened with peace to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
Acadia, at least. Crawford had just come overland from
Boston and knew that all was quiet.</p>

<p>Then, abruptly, before Crawford could move, the door
was again flung open and a man stood framed against the
night, pistol in hand. He grinned at Crawford—a great
figure whose clothes were white with ice-rime and snow,
his bearded face massive, brutal.</p>

<p>“Not a move, Saint-Castin!” rang out his voice.</p>

<p>Crawford smiled.</p>

<p>“Oh! I thought you were Saint-Castin!” he said.</p>

<p>The other started.</p>

<p>“Eh? What’s this? No one about——”</p>

<p>“Come in and shut the door!” said Crawford, and laid
down his book. “I’m cursed glad of company. The
baron is away, with all his people—gone to visit his
father-in-law, Madockawando. Up the Penobscot, I suppose.
Where the devil did you come from?”</p>

<p>“From the devil,” said the other, and laughed.</p>

<p>Then he whistled shrilly. Two other men joined him.
All three advanced into the room, closed the door, stood
staring over pistols at the seated figure of Crawford,
whose calm attitude puzzled them.</p>

<p>From outside came a shout, then a burst of voices,
the stamp of running feet, a sudden flicker of torches.
Surveying his visitors, Crawford perceived that the first
was obviously in command—his dominant air was beyond
mistake. The second man was a burly ruffian, brutish,
reeking of rum. The third man was tall and thin,
saturnine, hawk-nosed, with a certain air of down-at-heel
gentility; his darting black eyes were very intelligent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>“This is not the baron,” said this last rogue, blinking
at Crawford. “Not our man at all, cap’n!”</p>

<p>“Correct,” said Crawford amiably. “If one of you
gentlemen will set that venison pasty on the table, I’d
be obliged. I reached here half an hour ago, have not
eaten for two days, and am more interested in the venison
than in you. If you want the baron, go up the
Penobscot and look for him.”</p>

<p>“Cool one!” observed the massive leader, and suddenly
laughed. “We’ve lost the quarry, lads! Saint-Castin’s
away with all his people. Bose, go out and take
charge of the looting. Have everything taken to the
boats; no eating or drinking until the men are aboard.
When you’ve had your fill, come ashore with one boat
and join us here. No one is to loot this part of the
establishment until I’m ready. Frontin and I will join
our friend here over the pasty—if he hasn’t eaten for
two days, we’ve not eaten for three. Go!”</p>

<p>The burly ruffian departed. The saturnine man
stooped to the pasty and lifted it to the table, shoving
aside the body of the Micmac. The commander, thrusting
away his pistol, stepped forward to Crawford and
grinned widely.</p>

<p>“Well! Your name?”</p>

<p>“Harry Crawford, at your service.”</p>

<p>The two men stopped dead still, staring at him. Crawford,
faintly amused, smiled.</p>

<p>“Why, zounds!” broke out the leader. “Hal Crawford,
the pirate! Two hundred pound on his head in
Boston!”</p>

<p>“This is not Boston,” said Crawford, though his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
eyes narrowed. “Plague take you, stare! I’m for the
pasty.”</p>

<p>He whipped out his knife and attacked the contents
of the battered silver dish. The two men exchanged a
glance, then without more ado pulled forward a couple
of stools and joined in the assault, knives and fingers
ravenously at work.</p>

<p>No word was exchanged, but Crawford was by this
time perfectly aware of the profession, if not the identity,
of his visitors. During the past forty years the whole
American coast, even into Hudson Bay, had been swept
by pirates; small fry, most of them, fur-pirates, rum
pirates, reckless sailormen who would land to sack a
town or would lay a ship aboard and count it all in the
day’s work. Others followed the freebooting trade more
seriously and made of it a profession. Of this latter
class, thought Crawford, were the visitors. He had somewhere
heard the name of Frontin—and presently placed
it.</p>

<p>Within five minutes the pasty, among three famished
men, had been scraped to the last crumb, and the bottle
of wine was empty. Crawford leaned back, refilled his
pipe, and surveyed the other two men with a whimsical
air.</p>

<p>“Help yourselves to pipes, gentlemen! This house, as
the Spanish say, is yours.”</p>

<p>Frontin, the thin man, grinned in his saturnine way.</p>

<p>“That is well. May I introduce you to my captain,
Vanderberg the valiant?”</p>

<p>“The honor is mine,” said Crawford, nodding. “I already
recognized Captain Vanderberg. I believe Frontenac<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
has offered five thousand livres for his head?
Come, Lieutenant Frontin, you have a chance at fortune!
Deliver him to Quebec and me to Boston——”</p>

<p>Vanderberg, who was a jolly rascal of Dutch extraction,
bellowed a laugh at this.</p>

<p>“Ho! I like you, Crawford. Finding you here, the
baron gone, the house ours for the looting, means our
luck has changed. And, damme, we need the change!
We were battered by a French corvette, storm-wracked,
short of men and shorter of food. We bore up for Boston
but were warned off; we had absent-mindedly sacked
a Bostonnais off Jamaica, and the good folk had heard of
it, so the port was closed to us. We started for New
York, but were blown offshore by the gale which has
only just abated. So, if Frontin had not known of this
place and its chances of loot, food and wine——”</p>

<p>Vanderberg expressively waved one huge paw and went
to the fireplace. He took down the white stone calumet.
Frontin, his saturnine gaze on Crawford, spoke.</p>

<p>“So you are also on the account?”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said Crawford coolly.</p>

<p>Vanderberg swung around with a heavy stare.</p>

<p>“What? But we heard of you in Boston as a
pirate——”</p>

<p>“Exactly, in Boston,” said Crawford. “Having once
been a Jacobite in opinion, I took refuge in Massachusetts.
There, some months ago, I was recognized, apprehended,
and sent to the Barbados as a slave. I got
away with the help of some buccaneers, but having convictions
against the life of a pirate, I made my way to
New York. It was my intention to reach the Iroquois<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
country, certain Mohawk chiefs being my friends. I
failed to bribe old Fletcher, however, so he sent me in
chains to Boston. I escaped, headed for Acadia and
New France, and reached this spot half an hour before
you.”</p>

<p>Vanderberg exploded a volley of admiring oaths at
this tale.</p>

<p>“You have money?”</p>

<p>“I need none.”</p>

<p>“Well, you shall join us! I need a second lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“You honor me,” said Crawford drily. “But, as I
have said, I cherish certain convictions against piracy.”</p>

<p>“Bah! We shall prey only on the French.”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, I have no quarrel with the French.”</p>

<p>Vanderberg stared.</p>

<p>“<i>Hein?</i> What has that to do with it?”</p>

<p>“Everything. You will readily perceive that a man
who is destitute of everything except principles, would
be a fool to abandon his principles.”</p>

<p>“The foul fiend fly away with you! Then we shall
raid the coast to the south——”</p>

<p>“Unhappily, I have compunctions about letting English
blood.”</p>

<p>“But you are a pirate, known as such!”</p>

<p>“I have the name, yes, but not the honour of deserving
it,” said Crawford. “Reputation, my dear captain, is a
bubble blown from the pipe of fools; let us disregard it.
My quest, or if you so prefer, my urge to freedom, draws
me into the north or west; I care not which, so it be into
strange lands. Now, if I have need of a ship I am entirely
willing to seize any French, English or pirate ship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
which will further my purpose. I am not willing, however,
to seize a ship and kill men merely in order to
commit robbery. The distinction may be a trifle subtle
to your mind, but there it is.”</p>

<p>Vanderberg blinked heavily at this speech. Crawford
relaxed in his chair and puffed his pipe alight, quite at
his ease. Frontin, grinning delightedly, watched the two
men in obvious amusement. Apparently a cynical rogue,
this Frontin was not at all the cynic he pretended to be.</p>

<p>“You are mad!” said Vanderberg, beginning to lose his
good nature.</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” said Frontin, “he is entirely sane.
That is a profound truth, my honest captain. Very few
men are entirely——”</p>

<p>“Shut up!” snapped the pirate, and turned to Crawford.
“Who the devil are you against, then?”</p>

<p>“Nobody,” said Crawford calmly, “and everybody.”</p>

<p>“But you’re a Jacobite.”</p>

<p>“I was; I am not. I have perceived the fallacy of
giving allegiance to another man and fighting for him.
I shall now fight for myself alone.”</p>

<p>“Then you are going on the account?” asked Vanderberg,
rather helplessly.</p>

<p>“Not at all. I said—fight for myself! Why should I
fight for money? Why should I rob and murder in order
to take other men’s money and goods?”</p>

<p>Vanderberg swallowed hard.</p>

<p>“You are certainly mad!”</p>

<p>“No,” said Crawford. “I am free.”</p>

<p>Frontin jerked his stool forward and looked hard at
Crawford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>“Now let me have my say,” he said, and rubbed his
long nose. “You are free, and you are also sane. You
are something like Saint-Castin was once, before the
king’s jackal brought him to heel. I suppose you think
that it is a lucky chance that you are here?”</p>

<p>“Something of the sort,” said Crawford, wondering at
the man’s manner.</p>

<p>“No; it is a coincidence. You never heard of the Star
of Dreams?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Saint-Castin and I got it together, in the old days,”
said Frontin. “Now, consider! We want you with us,
for sensible reasons which will presently appear. We
came here for more than one reason—sensible reasons,
which lie in the chapel yonder,” and he nodded his head
toward a closed door. “The cap’n would plunder a
chapel, but I won’t let him. If you will argue with us
sensibly, and listen to reason, we may reach an understanding.”</p>

<p>“That is entirely possible,” said Crawford, with a slow
chuckle at the man’s air.</p>

<p>Frontin rose.</p>

<p>“Good! Take up the candle and come with us. We
have time to look and talk, while those men of ours fill
their bellies and guzzle wine.”</p>

<p>Crawford stood up and took the candlestick from the
table. He was at once amused, puzzled, and keenly interested
by these two men. He saw that Vanderberg
was a genial pirate, no more, no less—a brawny ruffian,
who was for the moment in good humour, and who could
pass swiftly to brute ferocity or brute lust. A man to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
met with utmost force, primitive in all instincts, actuated
only by an avid greed for gold or gain.</p>

<p>Frontin was different—a Frenchman very likely, a man
of high intelligence, capable alike of vicious cruelty and
lofty ideals. Vanderberg was the arm that smote, Frontin
was the brain that planned the blow. Of the two,
the latter was the deadlier.</p>

<p>Frontin crossed to the closed door as though he knew
the place well, and, his hand on the latch, turned to look at
Crawford.</p>

<p>“You love the English more than the French?”</p>

<p>Crawford shrugged.</p>

<p>“I think not. One buys scalps, the other tortures prisoners.
I deny them both.”</p>

<p>“In order to deny, one must affirm.”</p>

<p>“Precisely. I affirm—freedom, since you must have it
so. I seek only the chance to be free, to look beyond the
horizon, to leave wars and the quarrels of kings behind
me.”</p>

<p>“Your aim, then?”</p>

<p>“To be myself,” said Crawford, a little wearily.</p>

<p>Frontin flung open the door, a laugh on his lips.</p>

<p>“The private chapel of Jean Vincent de l’Abadie, Baron
de Saint-Castin. Your cap, cap’n; respect my religious
scruples.”</p>

<p>Vanderberg grunted, but took off his fur cap.</p>

<p>Holding up the candle, Crawford gazed upon a small
room at the farther end of which was an altar; there was
nothing bare here, but all was a glow of colour. Pictures,
silver candlesticks, a large crucifix, Portuguese
reliquaries of walnut with oddly curved glass front and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
sides, white cloths broidered in gold. The room was bitter
cold.</p>

<p>“Keep those itching fingers quiet, cap’n,” said Frontin,
and stepped forward. Crawford glanced at Vanderberg,
who was staring with eyes that glowed lustfully.</p>

<p>Frontin genuflected, then stepped to one of the reliquaries,
and from it took a small object. With a shiver,
he motioned back to the main room, and Crawford
obeyed. The three men came back to the fireplace, Frontin
closing the chapel door behind them. He then extended
the object which he had brought from the chapel.</p>

<p>Crawford, taking it, saw a five-pointed star six inches
in diameter made of soft virgin gold. In the centre was
set a large emerald, and other emeralds ran out to the
points. Some were flawed, others were remarkably clear
and deep in colour.</p>

<p>“Old?” he asked.</p>

<p>“A hundred years or so,” said Frontin. “From Peru.”</p>

<p>Vanderberg shoved his bulk between them and clutched
the star. He examined it greedily, breathing hoarsely,
his piggish eyes glinting in the firelight.</p>

<p>“This is no sacred thing!” he broke out accusingly. “I
shall take it. You can have nothing to say about it. I
swore to you that I would touch no sacred object——”</p>

<p>“You mistake, my captain,” said Frontin, a sudden cold
accent in his voice. “Turn it over and you will see the
name of the Archangel Michael graven on the back. It
was the belief that each archangel had his abode in a
certain star, you understand. This was a votive offering.
As such, it is sacred. Shall we argue the matter?”</p>

<p>This question came icily. Frontin’s hand was at his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
belt; his eyes met the gaze of Vanderberg in sharply direct
challenge. Then the laugh of Crawford cut in between
them.</p>

<p>“This theological argument would delight our friend
Saint-Castin!”</p>

<p>Vanderberg grunted and shoved the star at Frontin.</p>

<p>“Take it, papist! Now tell him about it.”</p>

<p>Frontin bowed, not without a certain courtliness. He
turned to Crawford.</p>

<p>“Once upon a time, I went to a certain place with
Saint-Castin; on the Newfoundland coast. Indians led
us. We found the wreck of an old Spanish ship, well-hidden,
or rather, I found it. Saint-Castin was taken ill
and could not go to the spot with me. I brought this
back to him as a sample of what the wreck contained.
Then some Boston fishing-sloops bore down on us, and
we had to flee. Later, events drove me on the road of
destiny. Saint-Castin was never able to find the spot
where the wreck lies, without my help; and he did not
have it. Now I am on my way to that place. I shall
enrich Cap’n Vanderberg and his men. Come with us
and you shall be enriched also. You perceive that our
reasons for coming here were sensible. What do you
say?”</p>

<p>Crawford stood for a moment in thought.</p>

<p>“Why this offer?” he responded at length. “Why are
you so anxious to enrich me? That, as you must agree,
is neither sensible nor reasonable.”</p>

<p>Frontin laughed gaily.</p>

<p>“No? Then listen. We have seventeen men including
ourselves. They are scum of the Indies—negroes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
branded men, escaped slaves. They suffer from cold and
famine. We officers are two, or if you count Bose, three.
We need one other man to keep control in our own hands.
They will not go farther north, yet farther north we must
go. They fear the French. They shrink from working
a ship adrift with ice. But this place supplies us with
food, wine, furs. On the Newfoundland coast we shall
get cod in plenty; we may pick up an English ship or
two, with luck. Is this sensible?”</p>

<p>“Eminently so,” said Crawford. “You need me, it
seems. Let’s smoke over it.”</p>

<p>He picked up his pipe, knocked it out, filled it with
the tobacco and willow-bark.</p>

<p>“Suppose you let me take another look at that emerald
thing—what did you call it? Star of Dreams?”</p>

<p>Frontin, who still held the star, pushed it across the
table. He, too, got a pipe from the mantel and filled it.
Vanderberg remained silent, puffing lustily.</p>

<p>Crawford looked again at the star and perceived a
ring at one of the points, by which it might be fastened
on a thong. The thing had no great intrinsic value,
since few of the emeralds were fine stones, but it held
that peculiar beauty which comes of primitive artistry
and crude technique guided by instinctively flawless
taste.</p>

<p>“Star of Dreams,” said Frontin. “It was Saint-Castin
called it that name.”</p>

<p>“A good name for it,” and Crawford nodded. “I
think I shall keep it. I like the thing.”</p>

<p>Vanderberg, who at most times was somewhat afraid of
his saturnine lieutenant, gaped at this remark. Crawford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
looked up and met the suddenly piercing gaze of
Frontin.</p>

<p>“You jest?” said the latter.</p>

<p>“Not at all.” Crawford looked again at the star in
his hand. “The name and the object appeal to my sentimental
nature, awaken poetic fancies in me, I assure you.
This thing might symbolize the star of freedom which I
pursue. At all events, it makes a certain appeal to me
which I cannot resist.”</p>

<p>Vanderberg grinned.</p>

<p>“So, Frontin! So! Another theological argument?”</p>

<p>Crawford glanced up and smiled.</p>

<p>“Not at all. I do not propose a theft, but an exchange
which will be more than even—which will, in fact, be
greatly to the advantage of our host’s chapel.”</p>

<p>He reached inside his shirt and pulled out a thong on
which was strung a blazing jewel, which, after unknotting
the thong, he laid upon the table. An exclamation
burst from Frontin.</p>

<p>“But—this is the Order of St. Louis!”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said Crawford, with a nod.</p>

<p>“His Most Catholic Majesty once decorated me with
it, and from a feeling of sentiment I preserved it through
many vicissitudes. Now, having abandoned sentiment,
kings and other old-world follies together, I am very
glad to leave this jewel here. You shall put it in Saint-Castin’s
reliquary. In place of it I will take the Star
of Dreams, as being worth infinitely less in money, and
infinitely more in the greatest things, which are intangible.
I trust that you will have no scruples in the matter
of such an exchange? The Blessed Virgin, or St.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
Michael, or whoever is the patron of yonder chapel, will
certainly profit by the trade. St. Louis for St. Michael—eh?”</p>

<p>Frontin compressed his lips, gazing at the jewelled
star. But Vanderberg was also gazing at the same thing,
with lustful and incredulous eyes, for in truth it was a
jewel of great worth. Then, abruptly, Vanderberg blurted
out his mind.</p>

<p>“Ha! Frontin—will you let him make fools of us?
Leave the relic where we found it, kill him, and take these
jewels. What’s to hinder, eh?”</p>

<p>“What, indeed?” murmured Frontin, raising his eyes
and looking hard at Crawford. The latter, who was
stringing the Star of Dreams on his leather thong, laughed
a little.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” he responded cheerfully, and apparently
without heeding the black regard. “Before you two fools
could out pistol, cock flint and draw fire, my tomahawk
would split the cap’n’s skull and my knife be in Frontin’s
heart. A pity, that, for Frontin is a man of some sense.
Nay, I learned knife and tomahawk play from my Mohawk
friends, gentlemen! Now, my dear Frontin, if
you wish to dispute my wishes in regard to this star, I
am entirely at your service.”</p>

<p>He leaned back and met the stare of Frontin with an
ingenuous air. Frontin burst into a laugh, rose, and
picked up the jewel of St. Louis.</p>

<p>“Bah! I am satisfied. Cap’n, don’t be a fool; we
need this man, and I like him, and the three of us shall
gut the galleon of treasure. What are a few jewels, when
gold is waiting to be carried off?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>Vanderberg sat back and puffed at the big calumet.
Frontin crossed to the door of the chapel and vanished
in the little, cold, dark room. Crawford nodded to the
big pirate.</p>

<p>“An odd soul, this Frontin of ours! I am glad that he
reverences something, for it raises him in my esteem.
By the way, you made a serious error in hurling a knife
into that redskin Micmac. He could have given you
some highly interesting information.”</p>

<p>“What, then?” asked Frontin, returning from the
chapel and closing its door.</p>

<p>“That Saint-Castin was expected home sometime this
evening. If I were you, I’d send a man or two up the
river-trail.”</p>

<p>Vanderberg, exploding an oath of consternation and
startled dismay, leaped to his feet. But Frontin was already
darting for the outside door. Jerking it open, he
whistled shrilly. A shout responded, and he turned, his
dark face alive with excitement.</p>

<p>“Bose is coming now. Crawford, you devil! If you
hadn’t told us this——”</p>

<p>“Well, haven’t I told you?” Crawford rose, laughing.
“There are some Winter garments in the bedroom adjoining.
Since we’re bound for Newfoundland, I think
I’ll help myself, and advise you to do the same.”</p>

<p>Stepping into an adjoining room, Crawford swiftly provided
himself with a large fur-lined wool capote, hat, and
a splendid pair of moccasins. He returned to find Bose
and half a dozen men around the doorway, Vanderberg
bawling orders at them. Two men with fusils were sent
to keep watch over the trail that led up-river, the others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
were set to work looting the interior of the house. They
reported that plenty of supplies had been taken aboard
the ketch, anchored in the bay.</p>

<p>The men hurled themselves upon the rooms, rushing
down to the waiting boat with loads of everything they
found—blankets, weapons, trading-goods, silver, snowshoes,
furs. Frontin, meantime, stood on guard at the
chapel door, defending it against intrusion, and Crawford
watched the man with a trace of admiration. Whatever
his real name, despite his dark past history and his present
occupation, this Frenchman was adamantine in upholding
his principles; and Crawford, whose whimsical
talk of principles and convictions was really more true
than he cared to admit seriously, found it in his heart to
respect and like this Frontin.</p>

<p>In the midst of the ransacking, Crawford heard the
plunging bark of a fusil. He whirled upon Vanderberg.</p>

<p>“You’re caught. Get your men to the boat, quick!
Wait there for me. I’ll hold off and gain you plenty of
time.”</p>

<p>Seizing from the mantel the large tomahawk which
he had retained as his own loot, Crawford darted from
the room, leaped out into the snow, and heard the shrill
whistles calling the men. A shout came from ahead,
around the corner of the buildings and up the river-trail;
then arose the biting Abnaki war whoop. Crawford
understood that the two men so recently set as an
outpost had been encountered by some of Saint-Castin’s
returning party.</p>

<p>Another fusil banged out its message, another Abnaki
yell went barking up into the frosty night. Ahead of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
him Crawford saw the two seamen stumbling back
through the trodden snow of the trail.</p>

<p>“To the boat, quickly!” he snapped at them, then
threw back his head and sent a long, quavering cry of
four syllables sounding up through the forest. It was
the most feared and dreaded sound that could be heard
in French or Algonquin ears—a sound to stop the very
heart-beats of Abnaki or Caniba or Malicete warriors,
a sound that, coming from the throat of the unknown
raiders, would bring Saint-Castin himself to a cautious
halt. It was the war-cry of the Mohawks.</p>

<p>“<i>Sassakouay!</i>”</p>

<p>It rose fierce and sharp with the true intonation that
Crawford’s red friends had taught him so carefully, ringing
up through the frosty trees, a veritable peal of doom
to Algonquin ears.</p>

<p>“<i>Kouay! Sassakouay!</i>”</p>

<p>A distant yelp, like the frightened outcry of a street
cur pursued by a mastiff, came from the depths of the
forest, then silence. Crawford, smiling grimly, turned
about and regained the front of the palisade. He found
Frontin waiting there, alone.</p>

<p>“They’ll scout cautiously,” he said, laughing a little.
“We’ve plenty of time. That Mohawk whoop will hold
them back more firmly than many muskets.”</p>

<p>“You took a chance that we’d wait for you,” said
Frontin.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. I knew you.”</p>

<p>Frontin grinned at that, and the two men were friends.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

HE WHO ACCEPTS AN OMEN, ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Crawford</span> could make out little of his new environment
until morning, which disclosed the
ketch <i>L’Irondelle</i> standing east for Cape Sable
and leaning over to a whirl of wind and snow from the
northwest.</p>

<p>The ketch was a miserable craft. Her foremast was
set nearly amidships and was square rigged, with a spritsail
forward, while the main carried a fore-and-aft mainsail
and a tiny square topsail above. She boasted three
twelve-pounders to a side, leaked like a sieve, was alive
with rats and vermin and was rotten of rigging, canvas
and wood from truck to keelson; her sole virtue was
speed in the water. As Vanderberger explained apologetically,
he had left Jamaica hoping from day to day
to get a better ship and augment his crew at one blow,
but luck had been against him. He was complacently
hopeful of picking up an English ship near Newfoundland,
unless a French frigate ran him down in Cabot
Strait.</p>

<p>“Those cursed French and English are always fighting
in these parts,” he declared mournfully, “and one
can never tell when a fleet will show over the horizon.”</p>

<p>The men forward, under the hulking ruffian Bose, were
a hard lot. Some were escaped negro slaves from Hispaniola,
some were French, and the remainder were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
Dutch and English. All had for the past two years been
engaged in the savage fighting and raids centring on
Jamaica, which had been an open prey to all men since
the great earthquake wiped away its defences and defenders.
Most of them were drunk, for during the night
Vanderberg had served out rum enough to conceal the
fact that he was heading east, and when the accession of
Crawford as third in command was proclaimed, it passed
the vote almost without comment.</p>

<p>“So long as we have no sun,” said Frontin in disgust,
“the rascals will hold the course we set and ask no questions.
Nine-tenths of them steer by the mark on the card
and cannot read the directions. But, my friend, when
they discover that we head north—ha! Then you’ll see
crimson snow. I’ve told them that we’re steering south,
and have altered the card in case any of those who can
read investigate the matter.”</p>

<p>Crawford shrugged.</p>

<p>“Better to meet the thing squarely—but let be. You
can navigate?”</p>

<p>“I was once <i>lieutenant de vaisseau</i> in his most Christian
Majesty’s navy.”</p>

<p>This was almost the only time in their long companionship
that Frontin ever referred to his mysterious past.</p>

<p>So the <i>Irondelle</i> drove east through long hours of grey
day and black night, while ever the bitter gale swept
down out of the northwest, and Vanderberg matched the
shrieking winds with his deep-chested roar. A rare seaman
was the Dutchman, knowing his ship as a book and
holding her under a press of sail that sent her scudding
like a race-horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>Bitter cold it was aboard the ketch. The men, inured
to privations, made no murmur; since the ballast was all
in rum from French Hispaniola, the black cook was kept
busy through the long hours dealing out hot grog without
cessation, and if the men went about their work half-drunk,
they had need to be so. The pumps had to be
manned continually, their monotonous clacking never
coming to an end. Now and again the rotten rigging
would give way, and up must go the men to reeve new
lines through frozen sheaves; twice the rotten canvas
blew out and had to be taken in, mended and patched
under the driving snow, sent up again; and the little
main topsail blew away altogether and vanished up the
sky. At this, Vanderberg bellowed gusty laughter.</p>

<p>“It’s a sign we’re not bound for hell this cruise, lads!
Spell the pumps, lest they freeze, and the rest of you fall
to work with axes.”</p>

<p>This, indeed, was the sternest job of all, one that had
no ending and was dangerous into the bargain. Gripping
the frozen life-lines, the men spread out and chopped
away the gathered snow and the ice, forming thicker
every moment. In the night this had to be done with
lanterns bobbing, black seas rising up out of the darkness
and sweeping the decks, new ice forming as fast as
the old was cut away, the blunt bows of the ketch smashing
over the roaring seas and a hissing rush of water
rising and sweeping away as each sea passed on.</p>

<p>Despite all this, despite their maudlin profanity and
half-mad frenzy of exertion, the men were cheerful
enough, for this was a new sort of privation to them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
Hunger and thirst and burning sun they were all too accustomed
to meet. Now they had taken aboard no lack
of wine, good caribou meat both frozen and smoked,
corn and meal and other viands, furs and warm clothing
galore, with no little booty in beaver and small loot.</p>

<p>The gale held through the second day, though the snow
had ceased and the bitter cold had lessened, so that it
seemed to the men they were indeed heading south.</p>

<p>“So long as they do not suspect, gain no sight of sun
or stars, and do not try to use their heads in the matter,
all well and good,” said Frontin. The three officers were
gathered in the stern cabin at noon, leaving the deck to
Bose. “They bear Crawford good will for the way he
halted Saint-Castin’s redskins and let us get off without
harm.”</p>

<p>Crawford grimaced. “The good will of vermin is not
valuable——”</p>

<p>“Pardon, but you will find that vermin bite!”</p>

<p>Vanderberg shoved into the talk, glaring at Frontin
from bloodshot, sleep-lacking eyes.</p>

<p>“Listen to me! We are heading northeast. The chart
shows that we shall run into a cape named Sable. What
about it?”</p>

<p>“Rest assured.” Frontin’s hawk-nosed, bitter features
were confident. “I know these waters well and need
none of your charts, which are not accurate.”</p>

<p>“We are in your hands,” said Vanderberg, with a nod.
“Now tell me just where we are going, for questions are
going to be asked before long. That devil Bose already
suspects that we’re not driving south.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>Frontin spilled a little rum on the table, out of the
great golden chalice that had belonged to Saint-Castin.
With his finger he drew the outline of a promontory.</p>

<p>“This is a point of land half-way around Newfoundland.
Here on one side is Conception Bay, on the other
Trinity Bay. Here in the end of the point is what the
English call a cove—a small harbour, without much protection,
therefore without ice. All along the shore are very
high cliffs. At one point along these cliffs, near the cove,
there is a ledge of rock that extends back into the cliffs
like a shallow cave; it is just above high water, and cannot
be reached in Summer because of tremendous tide-currents
and whirlpools that lie before it. Upon this
ledge is the wreck of the galleon, undoubtedly flung there
in some furious storm.”</p>

<p>Crawford interposed.</p>

<p>“Saint-Castin was there before with you; why could
he not have come again? Why could not the galleon
have been plundered by the English?”</p>

<p>Frontin smiled thinly.</p>

<p>“An Indian report of the wreck drew us there—some
hunters had seen it from the cliffs, or thought they had.
Saint-Castin was taken very ill and had to stay aboard
our ship. I climbed down to the place from the cliffs, but
would not do it again for a thousand pieces of eight.
The poor baron was too ill to understand anything about
it, and I most certainly did not tell him the truth, so
there you are. As for any one else having found the
wreck, that is impossible. No English settlements are
close by, the wreck is invisible from the sea, and boats
cannot come near the place in Summer because of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
whirlpools. In Winter, I believe there is sufficient shore ice
for us to land a mile or so from the spot and make
our way to it easily. Many ships come with supplies
from England for the various settlements during the
Winter, and we shall have no trouble exchanging this
craft of ours for a better ship. We shall not be disturbed
at the work, as the English settlers stay close at
home in the Winter, except the hunters who seek caribou
inland.”</p>

<p>Vanderberg looked doubtfully at Crawford.</p>

<p>“You are content?”</p>

<p>“Me—content?” Crawford laughed slightly. “My
dear cap’n, I have little interest in this wreck, I assure
you. If there is any gold, which I strongly doubt, a bit
of it may be of assistance to me.”</p>

<p>“The devil! If you’ve so cursed little interest, why
are you with us?”</p>

<p>“Because you are heading north. Two points of the
compass draw me; one is north, the other is west. If
I had a ship of my own, I would head it for Hudson’s
Bay; if I were ashore with an open trail, I would head
into the west. Since I must temporize with destiny, I am
here.”</p>

<p>“Sink me if I can understand you!” growled Vanderberg,
but Frontin uttered a low laugh.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will understand him too well one of
these days, my cap’n!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” said the badgered
Dutchman, glaring.</p>

<p>Frontin shrugged and winked at Crawford.</p>

<p>“I am like the Sybil of Cumæ—my meanings show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
only in the course of time. But the excellent <i>Irondelle</i>
is plunging heavily; shall we go above and clear the forecastle
of ice?”</p>

<p>The three of them tramped to the deck, and Frontin’s
whistle summoned the weary men.</p>

<p>That night the gale moderated, though the stars did
not show, and it had sunk by morning to a light breeze
off the land which brought down a rolling bank of fog.
After daybreak the wind freshened, and beneath its influence
and that of the sun the fog slowly began to shred
apart and dissipate.</p>

<p>Crawford was standing watch when, without warning,
the ketch suddenly slid through thinning fog into the
brilliant sunlight of open day. Behind, the grey wall of
fog went writhing down upon the horizon, and off the
starboard bow was the morning sun, blazing upon a
cloudless sky and a glittering blue sea unmarked by any
patch of sail or purple loom of land.</p>

<p>Sudden warmth pervaded the ship, and the watch on
deck gratefully relaxed to its comfort. Crawford was
standing beside the helm when he saw the man all agape,
staring from sea to sky; a shout came from forward, and
men pointed to the sun, and there arose a roar of discussion.</p>

<p>“Where away be we going, master?” queried the helmsman.
“Ha’ the sun changed his bed?”</p>

<p>Crawford chuckled.</p>

<p>“We’re bound north for Newfoundland, lad. North for
gold and Spanish plate, in a place the skipper knows of.
It’s there for the taking, and no fighting either; in and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
take it, out and sail south again to New York or where
you will, and spend the broad pieces. Yet those fools
for’ard don’t want to go north!”</p>

<p>The helmsman hesitated, then grinned.</p>

<p>“I’m with ’ee, master. Hast a pistol?”</p>

<p>Crawford shook his head and refused the proffered
weapon. Knife and tomahawk were at his belt, and he
wanted no more. Also, that large tomahawk of Saint-Castin’s
was nosed into the rail behind him, and he
quietly stepped over and secured it. Trouble was close,
for Bose and the other men were now on deck, all clustered
in an excited knot.</p>

<p>Now the knot burst, and aft strode the hulking figure
of Bose, bearded and uncouth as any bear, with the men
trailing to right and left. The ketch had but a slightly
raised quarterdeck or poop; Crawford strode forward to
the ladder of two steps and waited, secure in the knowledge
that the helmsman would not pistol him in the back.
The fourteen men came to a halt, sullen and anxious and
alarmed, and Bose stepped out a pace, glowering at
Crawford.</p>

<p>“Master, we be headed nor’east by the sun!”</p>

<p>“True,” said Crawford, his light-blue eyes searching
into the ring of faces. “We’re for Newfoundland, where
Spanish gold is waiting for us, and no Frenchmen around
to hinder——”</p>

<p>A storm of outcries went up in English, Dutch and
French, the protest breaking in an angry wave. Bose
flung about, silenced it with a roar, then swung again on
Crawford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>“This is a company matter,” said he, “and we’ll take
no orders from you that haven’t been voted on. North
we’ll not go——”</p>

<p>Crawford’s eyes and voice bit out at him like cold
steel.</p>

<p>“You dog, you! North you’ll go, and the rest of
you!”</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence, so shocked and taken
aback were they by this speech. Then Bose whipped out
a pistol and lifted it.</p>

<p>The next instant it was dashed from his hand, as the
tomahawk whirled and glittered and knocked the weapon
over the rail. Crawford put his hand to the second axe
at his belt and laughed.</p>

<p>“That’s it, eh? Now, bullies, who wants it fair between
the eyes? Fair warning, lads——”</p>

<p>Bose backed hastily into the crowd, but from the other
men came a storm of oaths. Then a huge negro at the
right of the gang moved suddenly.</p>

<p>“Down with him!” he shouted in French, and from
his hand a pistol roared.</p>

<p>The bullet shaved Crawford’s neck and left a red
weal to mark its passing; then the keen axe that flamed
in the sunlight took the giant squarely between the eyes
and sank into the skull, and the negro pitched backward
against the bulwark, where he kicked convulsively and
died.</p>

<p>“Knife to the next,” said Crawford, and took the knife
ready for the cast. But the men shrank, for this sort of
play was new to them. And as they hesitated, Crawford
spat forth an order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>“For’ard with you! The cap’n will tell you of our
course and where the gold awaits us; so vote all you
cursed please, but don’t come to me with pistols out.
For’ard with you! Hal Crawford goes north, and you
with him!”</p>

<p>Then he leaped at them, catching Bose a buffet that
knocked the hulking fellow across the deck. Knives
flamed, curses filled the air with wild outcry, and as the
men still hesitated, the powerful bellow of Vanderberg
arose. The cap’n leaped on deck, with Frontin at his
heels.</p>

<p>“What’s this?” cried Vanderberg, a pistol in each hand.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said Crawford, turning aft. “I was demonstrating
to these good fellows of yours that an Indian
axe is swifter than a pistol. The demonstration is satisfactory.
If you’ll break out a little rum, and tell these
lads of the wrecked galleon that we go to sack, the company
will vote for the north. Two of you lads throw
that black fellow overside and give me that tomahawk.”</p>

<p>Vanderberg strode forward. Frontin looked at Crawford,
and grinned thinly.</p>

<p>“You’ve cowed them,” said he. “Now watch your
back o’ dark nights.”</p>

<p>“Not I,” said Crawford, and pointed forward. “They’ll
fight for me now. You’ll see. They’ll be all for the north
venture.”</p>

<p>And a roar of applause to Vanderberg’s tale of gold
approved his prediction. Thus easily were the wild, childish
men swung to any purpose.</p>

<p>So, after troublous days, the <i>Irondelle</i> came to rest in
a little cove amid beetling cliffs, fast moored and well-sheltered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span> 
against anything but a blow direct from the
north.</p>

<p>She had not reached her goal without misadventure.
Off the Banks she had raised three sail of the line, one
foggy morning—French frigates, which only her virtue
of speed enabled her to escape. Of the thirteen hands
forward, one man had slipped on an icy shroud and
fallen to his death, another had been knifed in a quarrel;
this reduced the total aboard to fifteen. Wilful waste
had reduced Saint-Castin’s looted provisions to woeful
want, the gear aloft was dropping to shreds, there was
not a sound line aboard her save those that held her
moored off the black rocks, and the entire stock of powder
in the makeshift magazine had been flooded and
ruined. Yet, because the ballast of rum was not yet exhausted
and the lure of gold was before them, the men
were willing enough to face the worst. The one redeeming
feature was that in the bleak snow-clad land
fronting them there was no enemy.</p>

<p>On the night of their arrival in the cove, Vanderberg
summoned all hands aft to a council in the cabin. They
listened in silence as he laid the situation bluntly before
them—fierce, wolfish faces in the lantern-light, haggard
with toil and privation, lustful for unearned gold, branded
men and cutthroats and wild beasts in the image of God.</p>

<p>“Without powder,” concluded Vanderberg, “we are
defenceless. Without food, we are powerless. Without
gear and canvas, the ship cannot leave here. Without
more men, we could not work her south. Before us there
is a waste of snow and icy woods—a white desert. One
man among us knows this land; let him speak.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>All eyes went to Frontin. He, holding a candle to his
pipe, nodded his head coolly.</p>

<p>“Good. From that white desert facing us,” he said,
“we shall get men, provisions, powder, gear, and a ship.
Is that satisfactory?”</p>

<p>Some of the men cursed, others laughed. They liked
Frontin for his cool cruelty and his high intelligence.</p>

<p>“If you say so, then it will come to pass,” said Bose,
growling some blasphemy in his beard. “What about the
gold?”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, I cannot be in two places at once,”
said Frontin. “I propose that we divide into two parties.
I shall remain here with the cap’n and four men, to search
out the gold and, if possible, secure it. Seven men and
Bose, with Crawford in command, will go into the white
desert and bring us men, provisions, munitions, and a
ship. Eh?”</p>

<p>There was a roar of laughter at this proposal, which
was at once put to the vote and passed, amid a flood of
oaths and obscenities. Then Crawford spoke up for the
first time.</p>

<p>“The snow is deep. You will provide wings for us to
cross?”</p>

<p>Frontin grinned. “I brought Saint-Castin’s snowshoes
for the purpose. You can use them; the others can
learn.”</p>

<p>“I can use them,” spoke up Bose heavily. “I spent
a Winter in Hudson’s Bay, with the English company.”</p>

<p>“Excellent!” proclaimed Frontin. “Now, Crawford,
pay attention and you shall learn how this white desert
can be made to furnish all we lack. That is to say,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
provided your scruples against seizing English goods can
be overcome.”</p>

<p>Crawford shrugged and tamped down his pipe.</p>

<p>“Self-preservation is the answer, my dear Frontin. I
am at your service to command.”</p>

<p>Frontin once more drew upon the table-top a crude
outline of the iron promontory at whose tip they were
harboured. He put his finger at a spot on the west coast.</p>

<p>“Here, as I remember the map, is the English settlement
of Old Perlican, in a very good harbour. It is about
two leagues to the south of us. Opposite it, here on Conception
Bay, is another settlement called Bay de Verde.
How large these places are I do not know, but they are
of some size, and are only a few miles apart. I suggest
that you march straight down the coast to Old Perlican,
which you can reach to-morrow night.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Crawford ironically. “Then, without powder,
and with eight men at my back, I am to attack this
town?”</p>

<p>There was a roar of laughter, which Frontin swiftly
quelled.</p>

<p>“Not at all. You are to use those brains of yours, my
friend! If you have luck, you will find an English ship
at either or both of those places. You will find plenty
of sheep, cattle, and dried codfish. A prisoner or two,
correctly persuaded, will give you full information. At
the worst, you will find numerous fishing-sloops, excellent
seaworthy craft, into which you may load supplies.”</p>

<p>“And bring the whole coast down upon us?”</p>

<p>“Bah! Spread abroad some lies. No one will ever
suspect that we are harboured here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>“Very well,” said Crawford. “Get out the snowshoes,
Bose, and pick your men. If we have no powder, we need
not burden ourselves with fusils—so much the better!
If we do not return for a week or so, Vanderberg, you
have plenty of supplies for six men. If we do not return
at all——”</p>

<p>“But you will return,” said Frontin with assurance.
“You cannot fail.”</p>

<p>“Why so?” asked Crawford curiously.</p>

<p>“Because you follow the Star of Dreams.”</p>

<p>While the assembled men stared blankly at this, Crawford
met the glittering eyes of Frontin, and in that gaze
read an almost superstitious conviction. Somehow, he
perceived, the Frenchman had been captivated by his
words regarding the emerald star; and smiling at the
absurdity of it, he rose and left the assemblage to draw
lots for places in the expedition. After all, why not?
Perhaps this star, which hung on its thong inside his
shirt, and which was a good symbol of his rather vague
strivings and longings after a freedom that did not exist,
had been sent to him as an omen. His half-jesting utterance
had become verity.</p>

<p>“At least,” he thought as he looked up at the blazing
stars above the black cliffs, “it is possible. Frontin is a
man who reverences religion, and he believes it. I do
not reverence religion, but I reverence God—and I think
I believe it also. Well, we shall see! I accept the omen.”</p>

<p>Frowning thoughtfully, he sought his narrow berth.</p>

<p>Morning beheld a laughing, cursing, straggling expedition
of nine men starting off along the wooded crest
of the cliffs. Crawford led the way, a fusil slung over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
his back and one horn with a few charges of good powder
at his belt; behind him followed seven men, with
Bose bringing up the rear. As was their custom in all
things, the buccaneers donned the snowshoes and set
forth to sink or swim; and for a while it was a sinking
job. They stumbled, tripped, sprawled in the snow and,
like the huge children they were, enjoyed the game. The
intense cold was invigorating to them; they had food for
two days, their leader had enough powder to shoot any
game they met, and ahead was the prospect of loot against
heavy odds. From the buccaneer viewpoint the situation
was ideal—death at their backs, desperation prodding
them forward, all to win and nothing to lose. So
the winter-stilled woods echoed back lusty shouts of
laughter and wild curses and wilder jests, until Crawford
issued an order against too much noise.</p>

<p>The advance was not at all rapid. To most of the
men these crusted drifts of snow were entirely novel—a
thing to be enjoyed as well as fought. By noon, Crawford
calculated that no more than a league had been covered,
and he called a halt, the men promptly starting a
furious snow-fight, hurling cakes of icy consistency.</p>

<p>Crawford beckoned Bose apart and took out his pipe.
It was that same white stone pipe girded with silver,
which had rested on Saint-Castin’s mantel; Vanderberg
had looted it, and Crawford won it from him over the
dice on the way north.</p>

<p>“Give them a bite to eat and a rest, Bose. By night
they’ll all be done up with <i>mal de racquette</i>. I’m going
ahead to scout, so follow my trail. Give the men a tale<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
of Indians; whether true or not, it will lend them caution
and may keep the rogues quiet.”</p>

<p>Bose assented and ducked a cake of frozen snow that
came hurtling for him. Crawford, turning to the south,
was gone among the trees.</p>

<p>“A mad situation!” he thought, as he broke trail. “But
like all mad things, it has a grain of sense. If one could
only prevent the grain from being overborne by the
mass!”</p>

<p>He plunged ahead through the woods, bearing away
from the open shore and cliffs, since he knew well that
the sole hope of success lay in absolute surprise, and he
dared not risk being seen by settlers or hunters. Bose
and the men could follow his trail plainly enough, and
might come along whenever they were able. Crawford
was for the moment glad to be rid of them and unhampered.</p>

<p>No trace of smoke broke the blue sky. After an hour,
Crawford knew that somewhere not far ahead must lie
Old Perlican, yet he searched for it in vain. No slightest
indication of human habitation was to be seen anywhere in
this world of white snow, upon which the sunlight broke
with dazzling splendour. The trees were bowed beneath
their load of snow, and there was something terrible about
the deathly stillness, for the frost was not intense and
the trees were not cracking. This absolute silence of the
wilderness was hard on the nerves of one unused to it;
the only sound among the thickly clustering trees was
the faint creak and sluff of Crawford’s shoes in the crust.
Then, with a sudden savagery that brought him to gaping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
and incredulous halt, a voice lifted out of the dark
trees to his left.</p>

<p>“<i>Sassakouay!</i>” The gleeful, blood-gloating note
thrilled Crawford more than the whoop itself—thrilled
him with a sense of frightful things afield.</p>

<p>The Mohawk war whoop—here in this place! It was
absurdly out of all reason. Despite his surprise, Crawford
knew well enough that his own presence was unsuspected,
or that whoop would never have been lifted. He
went forward cautiously, working his way over a crest
of higher ground among thick pines, and so came abruptly
upon a road that lay below him. Biding there
in cover, he scrutinized it.</p>

<p>It was a road beaten deeply through the snow, marked
with the wheels of carts and the runners of sleds; since it
ran from east to west, it must be a road from Bay de
Verde to Old Perlican. Yet who had uttered that Mohawk
whoop, here in this solitude? That was a thing
inexplicable.</p>

<p>Only for a moment, however. Off to the left appeared
a moving shape—a man, bareheaded, running clumsily,
casting frightened glances over his shoulder, tearing off
a heavy coat as he ran. A sobbing cry burst from him,
directed apparently at high heaven, since it was impossible
that he could imagine any one to be near at hand.</p>

<p>“Help! Help! The red devils are on us—help! Ha’
mercy——”</p>

<p>Crawford stiffened in a momentary paralysis of utter
amazement. From the trees opposite him, and ahead of
the English settler, glided a figure which cut off the flight
of the settler. The figure was cloaked in long blanket-coat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span> 
and wide beaver hat, but from beneath the brim of
the hat peered out hideously painted features grinning
at the wretched fugitive.</p>

<p>Here was the source of that Mohawk whoop! Incredible
as it was, the thing was true. Crawford saw the
redskin deliberately whip out tomahawk and poise for
the throw, while the settler, plunging blindly along the
road, was ignorant of his doom. Crawford gripped his
own axe and, with a swift motion, hurled it—but too late.
The other had flung, and even as one blade hit home,
the second followed suit. Each man was destroyed by
an unseen enemy. Crawford’s axe struck through wide
hat to brain, and the woods rover plunged forward into
the road, without a cry. The hapless fugitive, struck
glancingly, but no less fatally, dropped in his tracks and
the tomahawks spun in the icy road beyond him.</p>

<p>For a moment Crawford waited, searching the farther
trees with keen scrutiny, appalled by what had just happened;
that the Mohawk could be raiding this country
was beyond belief. No sign of any one else could be
descried and, as he looked back to the two figures, came
the explanation. The rover’s wide hat had fallen away
to disclose reddish hair. He was no redskin, but a white
man, a Canadian—one of those <i>voyageurs</i> and <i>coureurs-de-bois</i>
who had adopted Indian habits, wives and appearance.
This explained the Mohawk cry, for many of
that clan had settled above Montreal and took the French
part against the English and Iroquois.</p>

<p>The English fugitive lifted his bloody head and came to
one knee. Crawford broke from his covert and, discarding
the snowshoes, ran to help the man, catching him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
in his arms. A glance showed that the wound was mortal,
but the dying eyes widened on Crawford.</p>

<p>“Who are ye?”</p>

<p>“A friend,” said Crawford, unwonted kindness in his
cold eyes. “I tried to get the rogue before he let fly,
but failed. Who is he? What does it mean?”</p>

<p>“English, be ye? On guard, on guard!” A flicker of
energy filled the fading voice. “I run away from ’em—the
devils are sweepin’ the coast! It’s Iberville himself,
they say—Canadians, Injuns! St. John’s captured,
burned; they’ve burned Heart’s Content, Havre de Grace,
all the settlements! Carbonear Island holds out—whence
come you that you know not these things?”</p>

<p>“I landed yesterday,” said Crawford.</p>

<p>“Then flee with your ship!” cried the dying man.
“There is no rescue—all is slaughter! Old Perlican is
burned—sloops burned—ship captured—ship from England
at Bay de Verde was taken last night—full of provisions—the
Irish slaves have risen against us—murder——”</p>

<p>The man’s head joggled forward in death.</p>

<p>So there was war in the land! Crawford stood for
a little in thought, astounded beyond measure by this
news. He had heard of Iberville ere this; that name was
both famous and infamous in New England, for it was
Iberville who had raided Schenectady with his Mohawk
brethren—a gentleman, an officer of the French navy,
a wild adventurer who halted for no odds, a Mohawk
by adoption. Such was Pierre le Moyne, Sieur d’Iberville.</p>

<p>“So Iberville is ahead of us, eh?” thought Crawford,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
and his lips twitched whimsically at the thought. “And
he took a ship of provisions last night, at Bay de Verde!
And what was that about Irish slaves? Poor devils of
Jacobites sent over here and branded! Sink me if all
this hasn’t a significant hint for my ears! M. d’Iberville,
I salute you! Now, my Star of Dreams—lead
on!”</p>

<p>Pausing only to retrieve his tomahawk and take the
fusil and munitions carried by the dead Canadian, he
turned about and hastened on the back trail to rejoin his
men.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

THE IMPORTANCE OF FORGOTTEN THINGS</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the late afternoon, five men sat about a fire on
the hillside north of Bay de Verde. Below them was
a scene of destruction; the settlers having broken
their parole, Iberville was laying waste the little place.
Canadians, hardly to be told from Indians, were driving
sheep and cattle to slaughter on the beach; the score of
log-houses were being pillaged, and already two of the
farther buildings were burning fiercely. The hapless settlers,
such of them as had not already escaped to Carbonear
Island, were being herded into fishing-sloops for
transportation to Placentia. Lying at anchor offshore
was a goodly bark of over sixty tons, just from England;
she was laden deep with stores, and by the gleam
of her canvas and the scarcely battered paint, was brand
new. She was schooner rigged.</p>

<p>The five men who had gathered about their fire, trees
closing them in on three sides, had obviously participated
in the sack of the place. Portions of a butchered sheep
were cooking at the fire. Four of the men, busy replacing
filthy rags with looted garments, were shaggy of hair
and beard, pinched and starving of countenance, and had
something the air of wild beasts as they pawed over heaps
of stolen articles.</p>

<p>The fifth man was different. He was prematurely
grey, his haggard face was drawn with suffering both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
mental and bodily, and in his forehead had been seared
an undistinguishable brand. Yet he seemed of a higher
intelligence than the others, who treated him with a certain
respect; and having changed his rags for good
clothes, he was at work with knife and broken mirror,
trimming his wild grey beard into some neatness. One
presently observed that he seemed different from the
others because of an undeniable cleanliness, which the
other four obtrusively lacked.</p>

<p>“Victory and blessings!” exclaimed one of the four,
staring down at the scene below. “If we had fusils or
pikes, and a <i>garran</i> to each one of us for riding, and
Phelim na Murtha yonder for the leading of us, it would
be plague to the Saxon!”</p>

<p>“True for you,” said another, speaking likewise in
Irish. “With the knowledge there is with us of this accursed
country, and the others of us who are elsewhere,
it’s a fine stroke here and there we could lay down! Do
we join the Frenchmen, Phelim?”</p>

<p>Thus addressed, the grey-haired man lifted his head
and regarded the four. In his eyes one saw that his
spirit remained unbroken, though his body might be far
spent.</p>

<p>“<i>Facies ut tua est voluntas</i>,” he murmured in Latin,
then smiled. “Nay, lads! Join them and gain freedom.
As for me, I am broken in body and my right leg will
never lose its limp, and the hair is grey that should be
black, and the forehead branded—nay! I shall get a
sword, and go to Carbonear Island and land among the
English, and die there after a last stroke at them.”</p>

<p>At this, a voice came out of the trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>“Well said, Sir Phelim Burke of Murtha!”</p>

<p>The four men sat staring around, dumfounded. But
Phelim Burke sprang to his feet, a wild light in his face,
his hands all a-tremble.</p>

<p>“Who called me? What voice is that?” he cried out.
“I used to know that voice——”</p>

<p>“D’ye remember Boyne Water, and the king who was
a coward, Phelim? And who it was called him coward
to his face, eh?”</p>

<p>Out from the nearer trees strode Crawford, laughing
a little as he gazed on the five of them. Now Sir Phelim
uttered a great cry.</p>

<p>“Harry Crawford—is it mad I am, or a ghost?”</p>

<p>“Try this,” and Crawford, leaving his snowshoes,
came over the trampled snow with hand extended.</p>

<p>The two men gripped.</p>

<p>“Gad, Phelim, what a meeting is this! All friends
here, eh? This is good enough. Tell ’em to down knives
before they smite me.”</p>

<p>Phelim Burke excitedly addressed the four, who were
closing in on Crawford, and they sheepishly relaxed.</p>

<p>“Harry, Harry, this is like a dream!” cried Sir Phelim,
tears standing in his eyes. “Two years we’ve been slaves
in this land, wild beasts of burden—art with Iberville?”</p>

<p>“Devil a bit,” and Crawford laughed. “Nor, as I
gathered from your speech—though I’ve forgotten the
Gaelic in large part—are you. I’ve a pirate craft hidden
up the coast. Will you and these men join me, Phelim?”</p>

<p>“Ay, to hell and back!” said Sir Phelim promptly.
“I’ll answer for them. But I’m a broken man——”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool,” snapped Crawford. “Listen, now!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
We’ve small time for talk, since the afternoon is wasting.
Is Iberville himself down yonder?”</p>

<p>“Ay, and forty devils of Canadians.”</p>

<p>“They are burning the place—there’s smoke from another
house.” Crawford’s gaze swept the little harbour.
“D’ye know when they are leaving?”</p>

<p>“Not until morning.”</p>

<p>“Excellent! I need men, Phelim. Five of you here—can
we get any more near by?”</p>

<p>Sir Phelim questioned his four. These, all of them
Sea Burkes out of Galway and veterans of the Irish wars
who had been taken prisoner and shipped to Newfoundland
as slaves, were eager enough to follow Crawford,
the more as he was an old friend and companion in arms
of Sir Phelim, whom they loved. They said that a number
of Irish were roving the woods, and several were
thought to be at Old Perlican, to which place a detachment
of Canadians had departed, with intent to give it
a like fate with that of Bay de Verde.</p>

<p>Crawford whistled, and in came Bose from his concealment
among the trees.</p>

<p>“Here are five of our fresh men, Bose, and down yonder
the ship awaiting us. Go back to where the men
are camped, set out a guard or two against roving Canadians,
and after dark bring them on to this spot. Off
with you! Now, Phelim, would it be possible for two
of your men to cover the six miles to Old Perlican, rouse
up any of their comrades whom they may find, and be
back here before dawn?”</p>

<p>At this, Phelim Burke laughed as he had not laughed
for many a month.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>“Lad, these Irish can outrun horses! And with freedom
awaiting them, what can they not do? They’ll be
back an hour past midnight, I promise you. One to
Old Perlican, the other three to roam the woods. Iberville
has released us all and offered us refuge in Canada,
but we’ll ship with you.”</p>

<p>The four Irish, waiting only to catch up their half-cooked
meat from the fire and bear it off to eat as they
went, departed hastily. Left alone, Crawford and Sir
Phelim settled down by the fire to bring old friendship
up to date.</p>

<p>Phelim Burke na Murtha had seen hard fate—his family
was wiped out, he himself had been racked and tortured,
and the two years here in Newfoundland in bestial
slavery to masters who knew no pity had all but finished
him; yet the spirit burned strong within him. He nodded
soberly to Crawford’s almost defiant declaration of freedom.</p>

<p>“Ay, Harry, I’m with you. The world’s burned out
for me, and I’ve no heart for the vain mockery that once
we loved. Throw all the stars into the bowl of night and
pluck one out, and follow it; then, lad, if you’ll be burdened
with a broken Irisher who seats mad whims higher
at table than sense——”</p>

<p>Suddenly Crawford, putting a hand under his shirt,
held before Burke’s amazed eyes the emerald jewel.</p>

<p>“Here’s your star, Phelim—Star of Dreams it’s named,
and I’ll live or die by it!”</p>

<p>He started up, pointed to the cove below.</p>

<p>“Look, man, look! There go more houses to the flames.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
You’re certain Iberville will stay here the night? Then
why send the buildings roaring?”</p>

<p>“He’ll stay, for he has to await the party back from
Old Perlican. As for houses, it’s little those wild Canadians
care for roofs over their heads, lad! Faith, ye
should ha’ seen Iberville and his men sweep over that
English bark at daybreak, against cannon and musketry!
It’s fighters they are, lad. Beside them the French are
fools.”</p>

<p>As the sunset drew on, Crawford heard how Iberville
and his six-score Canadian rovers had wiped the Newfoundland
settlements out of existence, yet doing it with
no needless slaughter. They had come overland from
Placentia in the dead of Winter and struck the east coasts
like a thunderbolt, nor could the scattered settlements
resist them, though there were some hundreds of hunters
to swell the ranks of the settlers. The impregnable island
of Carbonear alone held them at bay, while those who
escaped had fled to Bonavista in the north, which Iberville
would attack ere the snows melted.</p>

<p>Crawford in turn told Sir Phelim his own story, and
that of the Star of Dreams, and the darkness came upon
them while they talked, with the burned houses below
glowing as red patches against the star-glistening snow.</p>

<p>“If we can carry off that bark,” said Sir Phelim, a new
ring to his voice, “then I’ll ha’ faith in your Star of
Dreams, Harry! She’s loaded to the gunnel with supplies
of all kinds, carries three twelve-pounders and as many
culverins, and Iberville has put aboard her a good share
of the new-killed meat and the captured cod. What a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
prize she’d be for destitute men! But they’ll have a
guard aboard her, and how could we reach her?”</p>

<p>“That’s to find out,” said Crawford. “They’ll not suspect
you, Phelim—could ye not find out their dispositions,
and where the boats lie on the shore?”</p>

<p>Sir Phelim nodded and rose. He departed limping, by
reason of a broken leg that had knit poorly, and Crawford
stared after his vanished figure with sorrowing gaze.</p>

<p>“Devil take all kings!” he muttered. “There goes a
better man than any of the Stuart breed he has fought for—yet
at forty Phelim Burke is an old man of seventy!
And down yonder honest settlers are driven forth and good
Canadians are risking life and limb—murder is done and
steel cleaving flesh—for what? For the pride of besotted
fools who wear gilt crowns. I’ll fight, sink me if I don’t,
but it’ll be for my own hand, for my own life, for my own
free pleasure. Ay, my Star of Dreams, lead the way!
We’ll go over the horizon together.”</p>

<p>He built the fire up afresh, careless whether it were seen
by the French below, and, taking out his pipe, smoked in
thoughtful reflection. In throwing off all shackles of allegiance,
in declaring his quest of freedom, he knew well
that he made of himself nothing better than an outlaw;
he had no intention, however, of stalking up and down the
haunts of men and vaunting himself. He cared nothing
for the eyes of other men—he was questing that which
would answer to the inner man alone.</p>

<p>One thing he forgot—that every act committed in this
world, whether for good or ill, brings a certain reckoning
in its train. And now there was upon him the reckoning
of an act which he had already forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>The night was warm, the snow-crust was melting, and
though the stars were out there was rain in the air. Crawford,
as he sat before the crackling fire, heard no sound
whatever until a voice sounded at his very elbow in
French.</p>

<p>“Do not move, <i>monsieur</i>! My brother wishes to ask
you a question.”</p>

<p>Crawford glanced around, could see nothing, but caught
the click of a pistol at cock. Without sign of his surprise,
he took the pipe from his lips and laughed
shortly.</p>

<p>“Greetings, <i>mon ami</i>! You have somewhat the advantage
of me. Since I am prejudiced against speaking
with unseen friends, may I suggest that you advance
without fear?”</p>

<p>A somewhat boyish laugh sounded softly, but it died
out into ominous words.</p>

<p>“Your pardon, <i>monsieur</i>! This is an affair in which I
have no share, save that of curiosity—and compellance.
My brother Pierre-Jean Beovilh, the great war-chief of
the Abnakis, desires to ask you a question.”</p>

<p>While these words sounded at the elbow of Crawford, a
man stepped into the circle of firelight opposite him and
came to a halt. Crawford gazed curiously at the visitor,
not betraying the dismay which seized upon him; he saw
a tall Indian, who had flung aside his garments and stood
naked to the waist, painted and feathered, the features
repulsively ugly and ferocious. As he stared at the Abnaki,
the latter spoke to him curtly and without any of
the usual preliminaries, in very good French.</p>

<p>“Who are you, who hold in your hand the sacred calumet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
of the Abnaki, which has a home in the lodge of my
brother Saint-Castin at Pentagoet?”</p>

<p>And Crawford realized that the stone pipe in his hand
was one which had been taken from the mantel of Saint-Castin,
where pipes had stood racked.</p>

<p>Inspecting the war-chief, at whose belt hung fresh
scalps, Crawford took his time about responding. Suddenly
piecing together what he had previously learned
and what Phelim Burke had been telling him, he comprehended
his acute peril.</p>

<p>This Pierre-Jean Beovilh had come from Acadia to join
Iberville’s raiders, was the highest Abnaki chief, and belonged
to the now destroyed clan of the Caniba. Saint-Castin,
by his marriage to a red princess and his unsanctioned
union with many other ladies of colour, had constituted
himself a sort of vicar-general to the Abnakis. It
was highly probable that the sacred relics of the Caniba
clan had been deposited with him for safe-keeping, and
that this white stone calumet was one such relic, profaned
by Crawford’s usage.</p>

<p>Now, knowing himself trapped, Crawford took the one
open trail—that of audacity. He must know with whom
he dealt, for the greatest danger was that the whole
Canadian force would be brought upon him. One shot,
one yell, would bring them.</p>

<p>“In the <i>cabanes</i> of the Mohawk clan of the Iroquois I
am known as The Eagle,” he said calmly. There was
truth in this, though he had never visited the elm-bark
lodges of his Mohawk friends. “The Eagle does not talk
with cowards who fear to show themselves. Let my red
brother call his French friend out into the light.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>At the Mohawk name, the Abnaki chief started slightly.
Then, answering Crawford’s challenge, another figure
stepped from the shadows, pistol cocked. Crawford was
astonished, first to perceive that it was a boy of sixteen,
and second, by the aspect of this boy. He was handsome
as an Apollo, long brown curls framing his perfect features
and despite his youth there was a certain air of dignity
and command in his countenance. His eyes glinted
hard at Crawford as he spoke in French, using the redskin
phraseology.</p>

<p>“My white brother has a Mohawk name, but he is
not a Mohawk; he speaks with the French tongue, but he
is no Frenchman. Let him speak. I am Le Moyne de
Bienville.”</p>

<p>Bienville—brother to Iberville! Crawford could not
repress his astonishment as he regarded this boy of sixteen,
accompanying veteran wood-rovers on a raid so
perilous and even desperate. And reading the look, Bienville’s
boyish pride instantly resented it.</p>

<p>“Speak!” he snapped angrily. “Is The Eagle a woman,
that he fears to speak to warriors?”</p>

<p>The Abnaki chief, hand on knife, watched Crawford
with unwinking gaze.</p>

<p>“The Eagle looks at the sun and does not blink,” and
Crawford’s rare smile leaped out, so that the boy’s anger
vanished instantly under the implied compliment. “But
The Eagle has been asked a question by this snapping
cur. The Eagle did not know that the Abnakis had a
war-chief; he thought they were women, whom the French
Mohawks protected from the wrath of the Iroquois nation.
Now let this Caniba dog, whose clan is only a memory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
among the Abnaki nation, gaze upon this coat which The
Eagle wears. Let his eyes rest upon these moccasins.
He has often been in the lodge of Saint-Castin; perhaps
he will recognize them.”</p>

<p>The Abnaki, whose coppery breast was heaving with
rage at these words, spat reply.</p>

<p>“They belong to my brother Saint-Castin.”</p>

<p>At this, Bienville started slightly and watched Crawford
in astonished speculation. The latter puffed again at
his pipe, then spoke quietly, deliberately.</p>

<p>“Then let the Abnaki dog go and ask Saint-Castin for
an explanation. Or, since he is a woman and a snapping
cur at French heels, let him summon his Canadian friends
to make The Eagle a prisoner.”</p>

<p>Now the fury of the war-chief burst all bounds.</p>

<p>“The war-chief of the Abnakis does not need Canadians
to help him lift the scalp of a thieving Englishman,
who calls himself by a Mohawk name and speaks the
French tongue!”</p>

<p>Bienville, perhaps comprehending Crawford’s purpose,
attempted to interpose, but the furious chief turned upon
him with a flat demand that he keep silent.</p>

<p>“This English thief has insulted me and holds in his
hand the sacred calumet. This is not a matter for Canadians.
His scalp is mine, and I claim it!”</p>

<p>Then, whirling upon Crawford, the chief whipped out
a knife.</p>

<p>“Give me your scalp, English thief! It is mine.”</p>

<p>Now Bienville stood silent and perplexed, not knowing
who Crawford might be, and astounded at his having
come recently from Pentagoet; he could place Crawford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
for neither friend nor enemy. And Crawford, knowing
that he must prevent any summons to the Canadians, took
instant advantage of the boy’s perplexity.</p>

<p>“Keep out of it, Bienville,” he said rapidly, as he rose
to his feet. “I have a message for Iberville which is imperative.”
Then he looked at the Abnaki chief and smiled
frostily. “Your <i>manitou</i> has deserted you,” he said, using
the word <i>esprit</i> which translated the Indian term. “At the
name of the Iroquois your <i>manitou</i> trembles and is afraid.
That is a woman’s scalp at your belt, Caniba dog. Look,
how your <i>manitou</i> causes it to shake and quiver with
fright!”</p>

<p>For an instant the fury-red gaze of the chief dropped
to the silky scalp at his waist—and in that instant Crawford
was upon him. But his moccasins slipped in the soft
snow around the fire; the blow failed, and Crawford, unable
to regain balance, fell headlong.</p>

<p>Like a snake uncoiling in stroke, the Abnaki leaped.</p>

<p>Crawford twisted on his side in the snow, by a miracle
of dexterity evading the knife-blow, but he could not
evade the crushing weight of the redskin, which pinned
him down. He drove up blindly and desperately with his
own knife. The blade slid home in flesh, then the haft
was jerked from his hand as the Abnaki writhed up, only
slightly hurt.</p>

<p>For an instant Crawford, helpless to move, knew himself
lost. The chief was kneeling upon him, knife flashing
up for the finishing stroke; with a grunt, the redskin
brought it down for Crawford’s breast. The blow went
true—but the point swerved, turned sharply aside, glanced
from Crawford’s ribs into the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>The Star of Dreams had intervened.</p>

<p>“My <i>manitou</i> is strong,” panted Crawford, and threw
out his strength.</p>

<p>Astonished and dismayed by the happening, disconcerted
by those words, the Abnaki was caught in relaxation.
He swung sidewise, then Crawford had him by knife-arm
and throat and dragged him down in deadly embrace.</p>

<p>Through the snow they plunged, bodies interlocked in
a desperate grip, rolling over and over, while to one side
watched the eager-faced Bienville, lowered pistol forgotten.
Crawford knew himself the better man at this game,
feeling the throat-tendons of the redskin yield to his iron
fingers; but at the same time he felt the chief’s left hand
leave his arm and go down for the tomahawk at girdle.
Then, the heat of the fire close at hand, he hurled himself
sidelong, dragged the Indian over him, thrust that hideously
painted head and torso into the flames and embers
of the blaze.</p>

<p>War-chief or not, a low cry of mortal anguish escaped
the Abnaki, and his arms flew out. Crawford, rising to
his knees, drove a fist into the painted visage, then struck
once more, this time more carefully. The Abnaki relaxed,
senseless, and Crawford dragged his inert body back from
the fire.</p>

<p>“A stout rascal, egad!” he exclaimed, panting for
breath. “I should put the steel into him—but, unhappily,
I have convictions against murder, and I cannot conceive
of any immediate use to which I might put his scalp lock.
You may have his life, Bienville; I imagine that it is of
some value to you and your brother. By the way, the
priming has fallen out of that pistol. Better look to it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>Bienville, wide-eyed at the scene, glanced at his pistol,
laughed, and thrust it into his girdle. He stared at Crawford
in mingled admiration and perplexity.</p>

<p>“You are an Englishman, yet no enemy? You have
come from Saint-Castin? What did you say about a
message?”</p>

<p>Crawford chuckled.</p>

<p>“Ay, for Iberville. Your pardon, <i>monsieur</i>, one moment——”</p>

<p>As he stood, he had discerned a figure hovering outside
the firelight, and knew it for that of Phelim Burke.
He beckoned, his mind racing furiously as he stood there;
could he handle Bienville aright, everything was won—otherwise
all was lost.</p>

<p>“Come along, Phelim, and put up the knife,” he said,
laughing. “Sieur de Bienville, I think you have seen Sir
Phelim Burke before, since your force freed him from
bondage.”</p>

<p>Phelim limped forward.</p>

<p>“Shall I dirk the lad?” he asked in Irish, though anxiously.</p>

<p>“No,” said Crawford, while Bienville, divided between
startled alarm and perplexity, stared again. “Go and bring
up my men, quickly! They must be close by. Bring
them quietly.”</p>

<p>Sir Phelim, ready to use his knife if need were, yet relieved
that it was not demanded, went limping off into the
darkness. Bienville suddenly turned on Crawford with a
curt demand.</p>

<p>“Who in the name of the saints are you, <i>monsieur</i>? An
Irishman, by your words with that poor fellow. If you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
have a message for my brother, why have you not delivered
it to him instead of sitting here on the hillside?”</p>

<p>“All in good time,” and Crawford, with a whimsical
laugh, waved his hand. “Will you accept a seat at my
fire? I want to finish my smoke, and must keep an eye
on this red rascal lest he come awake and knife me unexpectedly.”</p>

<p>“I have not thanked you for your mercy to him,” said
Bienville, reluctantly seating himself. “It was well done,
<i>monsieur</i>. I should have been sorry to pistol you had
you slain him, for he is a great man among the Abnakis.
By what miracle did you escape his knife? I saw the
blow fall full——”</p>

<p>Crawford filled and lighted his pipe with a brand, then
put a hand to his shirt and through the gaping rent showed
the glittering Star of Dreams, now marked with a dent in
the soft virgin gold, and Bienville exclaimed at the smear
of blood.</p>

<p>“It’s nothing—a scrape of the skin,” said Crawford
lightly. He was fighting for time now, knowing well that
he had a young lion to deal with if he made one false
move. “It was a stroke of ill-luck that made your Abnaki
recognize that pipe. I helped myself from Saint-Castin’s
mantel rack, never dreaming that one pipe was
more than another.”</p>

<p>Bienville laughed boyishly.</p>

<p>“I should have liked to hear Saint-Castin curse when he
discovered which one you had taken! Then you have
come by way of Placentia, eh? Heard you anything of
the fleet from France? My brother Serigny was to bring
a fleet which the king promised to give Pierre——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>Crawford remembered the French sail of the line they
had raised off the Banks.</p>

<p>“The ships are at Placentia now,” he said, “though my
message does not deal with them. But your pardon, <i>monsieur</i>.
My name is Crawford, and I was formerly an officer
of his Majesty of St. Germains. At present I am
following my star of destiny. The Irish gentleman whom
you just now beheld is an old friend——”</p>

<p>At this instant the Abnaki chief uttered a low groan
and moved slightly. Crawford swiftly turned, picked up
some of the rags that the Irish had discarded, and with
these he knelt above the chief, binding the latter firmly
and gagging him to boot. A crunch of snow caused him
to look up—and he saw a tall figure come into the circle
of light.</p>

<p>“Ten thousand devils!” exclaimed a rich, vibrant voice.
“What’s this, Bienville? You and the chief flitting off
after dark—who is this man?”</p>

<p>Crawford rose, and his heart sank. What a scurvy
trick of fate, when all was in his hands so neatly! For,
though the newcomer was garbed as any other woods-loper,
Crawford did not need to be told that he was facing
Pierre le Moyne, Sieur d’Iberville.</p>

<p>“This, my brother,” said Bienville hastily, “is the Sieur
Crawford. He has come from Pentagoet with a message
from Saint-Castin. The war-chief quarrelled with him,
and he bested the chief in fair fight and spared his life.”</p>

<p>Crawford scarce listened, for he was staring at Iberville,
yet seeking past the latter with every sense acutely
strained. Incredible as it seemed, there was no one else;
Iberville had come alone, perhaps to discover what Bienville<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
and the Abnaki were doing at this hillside blaze.
For Iberville, having lost more than one brother at his
very side in border raids, cherished most tenderly this
youngest scion of the Le Moyne stock.</p>

<p>Energy radiated from the man who stood surveying
Crawford. Those masterful eyes, so wide-set in his head,
those delicate lines of brow and nostril and lip, that great
jutting beak of a nose, long upper lip, heavy oval jaw—all
of these spelled the man within, impatient of restraint,
reckless of obstacles, daring heaven or hell on a cast of the
dice. No half-way man was Iberville, and showed it.</p>

<p>“And the fleet’s at Placentia!” broke out Bienville suddenly.
“Serigny has come!”</p>

<p>Now Iberville started, and a sudden flash gleamed in
his eyes.</p>

<p>“Ha! You have letters for me? Orders? Word from
Placentia?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Crawford. “I chanced to see the fleet on
my way here, that is all. I did not stop at Placentia, for
reasons which were excellent at the time——”</p>

<p>But Iberville had lifted his head, his eyes darting to the
trees around. Least of all men to be caught napping was
this veteran of many a warpath, from Hudson Bay to
Albany. His hand snatched at the tomahawk in his girdle.</p>

<p>“Men around us!” he snapped. “Back, Bienville——”</p>

<p>“My men,” said Crawford, and drew a great breath of
relief. Then he laughed lightly. “And if they are not
half-dead with snowshoe sickness, sink me!”</p>

<p>He lifted his voice.</p>

<p>“Ho, there! Sir Phelim? Bose? Come along to the
fire and have a care what you do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>“Ay,” rejoined the heavy tones of Bose, from among
the nearer trees. “But these snowshoes be killin’ the
rogues—groan all ye want now, ye dogs!”</p>

<p>The sound of muffled curses and groans that followed
his words brought a laugh to Crawford’s lips, and even
Iberville’s wide mouth twitched in a grim smile. Crawford
now played his luck hard; by some miracle the game
was all in his hands for the winning, and it was time
for the final cast of dice which must win or lose. And,
as he perceived in a flash, he must stake all on such a
cast as would be thrown only by a fool, a madman—or a
gentleman. Abandon Sir Phelim’s Irishmen he could not,
yet they would not arrive until past midnight at earliest.
He must dare Iberville, man to man, soul to soul, and his
one desperate hope of success was to evoke from the man’s
spirit its qualities of reckless abandon and high nobility—and
trust to them.</p>

<p>Knocking out his pipe and pouching it, Crawford
stepped around the fire to Iberville, and spoke in a low
voice. “I have a message for your ears alone. Above
all, it must not reach Bienville. Will you step aside with
me, so that we may speak in private?”</p>

<p>Iberville flashed a glance at the boy, another glance at
the surrounding trees. From these, the hulking figure of
Bose was appearing. Crawford turned with a curt order.</p>

<p>“Keep your men around the fire. Make no noise.
Leave me to speak in peace with this gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Ay,” said Bose, and stooped to get free of his snowshoes.</p>

<p>“I am at your service, <i>monsieur</i>,” said Iberville quietly.
“Come a few paces down the hillside.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>There was a peculiar timbre in his voice. By some instinctive
leap of the mind, Crawford knew instantly that
Iberville had comprehended everything.</p>

<p>“Careful!” he said. “Hear me out first, for the sake
of the boy.”</p>

<p>Iberville flashed him an astonished glance. They halted,
a dozen paces from the fire, around which the men were
now gathering.</p>

<p>“Eh? For the love of the saints, do you read a man’s
mind?”</p>

<p>“Desperation, my dear Iberville, breeds miracles, as
you should know.” Crawford spoke lightly, swiftly, for
desperation was indeed driving him. “It is true that I
have just come from Pentagoet, where I had the pleasure
of looting the establishment of Baron de Saint-Castin.
Bienville was a trifle hasty in jumping at conclusions, for
the message that I bring you is from—myself. I am, by
force of necessity, compelled to act the part of a pirate.
Those men of mine, and others awaiting me on the coast,
are destitute. Now, in this harbour below us there is an
excellent ship, heavily laden with all things; and I’m going
to have that ship. I think it is in your mind to tomahawk
me, rescue your brother from a situation which might
prove embarrassing to him, and summon your Canadians.
But, I beg of you, postpone this action until you hear me
out. To tell the truth, I’ve had a devil of a wrestling
match with your Abnaki chief, and I’m still a trifle short
of breath.”</p>

<p>Iberville burst into a laugh, compounded of anger and
amusement. “My faith, <i>monsieur</i>! I believe that you’re
a madman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“I might agree with you,” said Crawford whimsically,
“and that would prove me sane! As it happens, Iberville,
I have no quarrel with you or with Frenchmen. Indeed,
several of my men yonder are from French Hispaniola.
Nor have I any intention of pirating French commerce.
The plain facts of the case are that you got ahead of me
by a few hours, in capturing yonder bark, and now I must
insist that you hand her over to me.”</p>

<p>“I am not in the habit of yielding up what I have
seized,” said Iberville coldly.</p>

<p>“Precisely. Therefore, I would point out to you that
the situation offers a most interesting opportunity of giving
a <i>quid pro quo</i>. First consider, my dear Iberville,
that habits are things which none of us like to break, but
which all of us must sometime break unless they are to
master us.”</p>

<p>Iberville chuckled at that, and Crawford continued
swiftly.</p>

<p>“Then consider, I pray you: Item, I am not in the
habit of murdering prisoners, or of shooting down boys.
Item, those buccaneers who obey me are in the habit of
doing both things. You perceive the obvious exchange?
If you break your habit of keeping what you have seized,
those pirates of mine will then break their habit of murdering;
that is to say, if you turn over the bark to me, the
Abnaki chief and Bienville go free. But if you refuse to
break this habit of yours, then I am unhappily compelled
to break my own habit—in effect, to kill the Abnaki and
also your brother. The chief’s blood would not trouble
my conscience in the least, while I know that you would
go to great lengths to avoid his death, as a matter of policy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
toward your Indian allies; yet I confess that I would kill
Bienville with the greatest of reluctance.”</p>

<p>“Why, you cursed philosopher-pirate, you couldn’t
touch him!” exclaimed Iberville, laughing amusedly.
“Devil take you, come and join me! I like you, Monsieur
Crawford. You shall have a royal commission
under me, and I’ll grant amnesty to your pirates and free
transportation to Boston or where they will. Eh?”</p>

<p>The offer was sincere and cordial, and Crawford regretfully
shook his head.</p>

<p>“My dear Iberville, I have sworn to give no more allegiance
to kings. I am going into the wilderness to seek
freedom—north or west, as may be. The old ways of life
are as an empty sheath, from which I have drawn the
sword; and I go forward with the naked blade. I serve
myself, I acknowledge no master, I seek no man’s gold—but
there! You’ll be calling me a madman again.”</p>

<p>“A madman? No.” Iberville swept him with a keen
glance, as they stood under the starlight. “My faith,
man! Sometimes I myself am tempted—but never mind.
<i>Vive le roi!</i> You’ve tasted freedom and I can’t blame
you, though I’m sorry you’ll not accept my offer.”</p>

<p>Iberville paused an instant. “Did you ever hear of the
Star Woman?” he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>“No.” Crawford was astonished by the question.
“Who is she?”</p>

<p>“A fit subject for your investigations—beyond the
horizon.” A short laugh came from the other man, yet
there was a lingering regret in his tone. “Perrot once
told me about her; you know of Sieur Perrot the explorer,
of course. A queen among the far western Indians, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
great enchantress, a female <i>jongleur</i>. One of the Cree
chiefs let slip something about her two years ago, when
I was at the bay. Well, well, there is no time to talk of
dreams! Come—what’s your exact proposal to me, monsieur?”</p>

<p>Crawford dismissed the name of the Star Woman,
though it had struck his fancy. Some Indian legend, beyond
question.</p>

<p>“My terms are fairly obvious,” he returned coolly.
“I’m as good a man as you with the knife or tomahawk,
so you’d not down me and get away with ease. Bienville
is surrounded, yonder, and the Abnaki is bound. Now,
you’ll not favour me to save your own skin, but you’ll do
it to save the two over there. The bark is not worth so
much to Canada as are those two lives.”</p>

<p>“At a call from me,” said Iberville reflectively, “my
Canadians would put you all to the stake.”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly, but you would be in no position to enjoy
the spectacle, I assure you!”</p>

<p>“True. Yet I am rather warm in the notion of taking
that bark and her cargo into Placentia.”</p>

<p>“And, my dear Iberville, I am most devilish warm in
the necessity of having her myself. Egad, man! Do you
want me to go down to Carbonear Island and head these
English against you? They have no officers, no leaders,
and are helpless, but if I undertake to lead them, I’ll
guarantee to cut you off from Placentia——”</p>

<p>Iberville broke into a laugh and clapped him on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Monsieur Crawford, Satan take me if you’re not a
man after my own heart! You shall have the bark. My<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
word upon it. Call your men and I’ll give you boats to
get aboard.”</p>

<p>“I can’t do it, Iberville. I’ve promised to wait here
until after midnight for some of the escaped Irish slaves
who are coming to join me.”</p>

<p>“What?” exclaimed Iberville. “Faith, you can’t expect
to keep the three of us prisoners here until after midnight,
without my <i>voyageurs</i> hacking at the hinges of
hell to find us! Unless, of course, you propose to use us
as hostages——”</p>

<p>“Not in the least,” said Crawford quickly. “It will
give me great pleasure if you’ll take that Abnaki devil
with you and keep him quiet until we get off. Bienville,
of course, will know nothing of the entire matter; it remains
between the two of us alone. If you will see to it
that your men are off the bark, and that your Canadians
do not interfere with us, we shall come down to the beach
as soon as my Irish arrive, go aboard, and sail away.
As you will perceive, it is all very simple.”</p>

<p>Iberville stared at him for a moment.</p>

<p>“Satan fly away with me! Are you in earnest?”</p>

<p>“Eh? Why, of course! Do you find the proposal disagreeable?”</p>

<p>A short laugh broke from the Canadian.</p>

<p>“What assurance have you that I’ll not lay an ambush
at the shore and cut you off to the last man?”</p>

<p>“Every assurance in the world.”</p>

<p>“What, then?”</p>

<p>“The fact that you are Iberville.”</p>

<p>The other was silent a moment, then spoke softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>“Monsieur Crawford, I offer you my most respectful
homage. Shall we rejoin my brother?”</p>

<p>They turned back together to the fire. There Bienville
was laughing heartily and exchanging jests with the
buccaneers who, weary and cursing the snowshoes that
had left them almost unable to hobble, were rubbing sore
tendons. The Abnaki chief, conscious, was glaring up at
Sir Phelim Burke, who was seated grimly beside him.</p>

<p>Crawford strode forward and cut the chief loose, and
at a few words in Algonquin from Iberville, he stalked
off into the darkness. Crawford checked his men with a
gesture.</p>

<p>“Come, Bienville,” said the tall Canadian, and swept
off his hat. “Monsieur Crawford, I salute you. To our
next meeting!”</p>

<p>The two figures disappeared. Sir Phelim stared after
them, then lifted wondering eyes to Crawford.</p>

<p>“<i>Hanam-an-diaoul!</i> Is it a wizard ye are, Harry?
What’s happened, lad? What’s happened, that ye let
those three go——”</p>

<p>“Nothing’s happened, Phelim, except that the Star of
Dreams is shining fair for us,” said Crawford.</p>

<p>Yet he sighed a little as he turned to tell the men of
the ship that lay awaiting them, and in his heart there was
a wish that some day he might again meet that tall Canadian,
for he felt strangely drawn to the man.</p>

<p>Perhaps, for all his boasted quest of freedom, that offer
of a commission under Iberville had been a sore temptation.
And the name of the Star Woman lingered strangely
in his memory.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

ONE GAINS GOLD, ANOTHER A FRIEND</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the meanwhile, during three days the men left
aboard the <i>Irondelle</i> slaved, as Vanderberg put it, like
dogs of Holland, yet never was slavery more richly
rewarded.</p>

<p>Frontin’s hawk-nose led them aright, but not his calculations,
for so toilsome was the road along the shore ice
under the cliffs, that in the end Vanderberg rigged shears
up above and rove his unrotted mooring-lines together,
and so made an easy descent and a quick road over the
snow above the cliffs. This let the <i>Irondelle</i> pursue her
own fate, and a current threw her ashore when the remaining
bower-hawser chafed through and she lay
stranded on a shallow.</p>

<p>Who cared? They were mad, those men, doing the
work of giants for the reward of the earth-gnomes. On
the ledge under the cliff, the ledge which was flooded at
high tide, or had been, were great masses of snow-clear ice
like crystal, and under the ice lay the shattered and sundered
galleon, and chests plain to be seen. Then there
was chopping and splitting of ice, and Frontin dried out
the wet powder and tampered with it, and made some of
it to burn so that the ice was riven asunder.</p>

<p>Because the days were short, they hurled dead trees
and logs over the cliff-edge, and built them fires on the
ledge, laboring through the night. When wearied, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
dropped and slept, and rose and took up axe and chisel
again, now snatching a bite to eat and now a dram of
hot rum, staggering as they hewed; and the smoke of the
burning rose up by day and the flame seared the cliff-side
by night. In three days those six men accomplished what
any other twelve men would have done in a fortnight, so
that in the end they reached the shattered galleon.</p>

<p>On the fourth day came to pass the prodigious finale.
The plunder was got at and laid out—six chests of mahogany
bound with sea-greened brass, three baggy canvas
sacks bulging with gold cups and like articles, and two
casks of good Spanish wine. Frontin and the four men
were swung up to the cliff-top to haul, while Vanderberg
remained below to make each chest fast in turn. A hard
driving rain had been falling all night, and Vanderberg
had laid fire to the high carven stern-portion of the galleon’s
wreck, so that presently the ledge and the niche in
the cliffs were roaring warm, and the work went on merrily.
One by one the chests swung up, and the bags, and
one of the casks of wine. Then, as Vanderberg was making
fast the second cask, the fire reached some unsuspected
powder in the wreck.</p>

<p>Those up above knew not what had happened, nor
cared greatly, for the rain was driving down and they had
broached the cask of wine and were hammering at one of
the mahogany chests for a sight of the gold. Then, when
the shock of the explosion was gone, and the roaring
echoes had died out, they heard Vanderberg bawling at
them and saw the rope shaking; so Frontin flailed them
to the lines, and presently the captain was hauled up and
landed like a sack of meal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>All fell to laughing at him, for he was spitting oaths and
curses like any cat; the clothes were stripped from him,
half the great beard was flamed away, and a brand had
smitten him across the face, blackening him and bringing
the claret from his nostrils in a stream.</p>

<p>“The day of miracles isn’t passed yet,” cackled Frontin.
“Faith, we left you a Dutchman and up you come a
black Guinea-man!”</p>

<p>“Give me your breeches, damn you,” roared Vanderberg,
who was furious.</p>

<p>“Go to the devil,” said Frontin, and turned to draw a
cup of wine, but Vanderberg struck him from one side
and sent him senseless into the snow.</p>

<p>Now Vanderberg stripped one of the men, donned the
wet clothes, and sent the fellow running naked in his
boots through the rain and snow for the <i>Irondelle</i>. Then,
repenting the blow and perhaps a little afraid, he roused
Frontin to life and held wine to his lips.</p>

<p>“Fiend take me, it was a foul blow,” said he.</p>

<p>Frontin gulped the wine, staggered up, and felt his jaw.
He gave the captain one look from his glittering eyes, then
shrugged.</p>

<p>“It’s nothing,” he said lightly, while the men gaped, expecting
a fight. “Come, to work! We must get these
chests and bags to the cove.”</p>

<p>So that matter passed over, for the moment, though
more than likely it drew certain results in train.</p>

<p>Frontin showed them how to make a <i>travois</i> of poles,
on which the chests might be dragged by two men. The
first was loaded with a chest and sent off, and a second
was made and sent off likewise, Frontin and the fourth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
man dragging it, while Vanderberg followed with one of
the bags of small loot pulling from his wide shoulders.</p>

<p>When they neared the cove, the man who had gone to
clothe himself now came running, with word that the tide
was high and the ketch was floated from the shoal. Sure
enough, they sighted the <i>Irondelle</i> on an even keel and
drifting with the currents toward an inner ledge of rocks,
though there was a drift of wind and rain offshore. Now,
with the gold safely garnered, wakened thoughts of safety,
and there was a wild race down to the cove. Tumbling
into the boat, they rowed to the ketch and fell to work;
she was a sorry thing enough, but better than naught, and
there was no time to lose, the tide being at flood.</p>

<p>While Vanderberg fell to work with the hawser-lines
they had brought back, bending them to the larboard
bower, Frontin and another man got a butt sawed asunder
and slung, while the other three loosed the fore-topsail,
eased the buntlines, braced the yard and hauled home
the sheets and sent the rotten, mended canvas up to catch
the higher drift of wind. Leaving Vanderberg and another
to brace up as required, Frontin and the three remaining
men tumbled into the boat, took out a coil of the
old feeble rope, spanned the boat from stem to stern, and
set out the butts. The captain and his one man hauled
in, the boat hung athwart, and with the dragging butts
counteracted the pull of the current. So the ketch got a
start, and the upper breeze caught her topsail, and she
drew away from the rocky ledge. In two minutes she
was moored again by one hawser and safe enough.</p>

<p>Then, with a pint stoup of raw rum all around, it was
back to the shore again and all hands for the gold. By<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
the time the six chests and the bags and what was left of
the Spanish wine was got down to the cove, the six of them
were reeling and staggering with maudlin weariness, and
the afternoon half-gone. To get the gold aboard ship and
finish their task, however, remained; and Vanderberg
drove them at it. Racked and rain-soaked, weary to
death, swigging more rum and cursing the gold and the
rain, they made shift to row out the boat again and again,
until at last the burden was on deck. Then there was a
flicker of life as a chest was hammered open, and gold
gleamed in little heavy bars all stamped with the Spanish
seal; after this they dropped below like dead men and
lay huddled in any shelter they could find, and slept.</p>

<p>Sometime toward morning Vanderberg wakened with
cold; the rain had ceased and frost was come again with
a clear sky. He got lanterns lighted and a fire going in
the galley, and with the dawn all hands were about, the
last of the food was set forth, and the click-clack of the
pumps was heard. One of the blackamoors went down for
more rum, but he came out of the hold with his face all
grey.</p>

<p>“The devil has got us now!” he shouted out. “She’s all
under water, and a butt started, and the seams opened by
the pounding.”</p>

<p>“Then let her sink and be damned,” said Vanderberg,
with a storm of oaths. “We’re in three fathoms and can’t
hurt.”</p>

<p>By sunrise, indeed, she was settled on bottom, with the
side down; but an hour after this there was a shout from
the cook on deck. The others were below, eating like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
starved men, and poured up to see two craft standing in
around the headland for the cove.</p>

<p>“English!” said Frontin coolly. “A bark and a ketch,
and either of them could master us——”</p>

<p>Oaths stormed and curses rang, for there was no powder
and the guns were useless. Some wanted to flee ashore
with the gold, but Vanderberg, his half-beard floating in
the wind, cursed them into silence and ordered the guns
unstopped and run out.</p>

<p>“Little they know we can’t bite!” said he. While they
were at this, however, and the two English ships running
into the cove, Frontin fell suddenly to laughing and
pointed to a man in the bows of the bark, which was the
nearer craft.</p>

<p>“There’s Bose—ha! Crawford has brought us the
ships and men.”</p>

<p>Oaths and sour curses changed to yells of mad delight,
which were answered from the two ships; and these ran
down and anchored a cable-length away. A boat put off
from the ketch, with Crawford in her, and picked up Bose
from the bark. When Vanderberg saw all his old men
coming in the boat, and other men still aboard the bark,
he swore with mad joy that Crawford should have an
extra share of the gold, to which the other men joined
their vote. But Frontin stood to one side, his glittering
eyes hard and cold, and a saturnine smile just touching
his thin lips.</p>

<p>Crawford came over the rail, Bose and the men poured
aboard, and there was pandemonium for a while, stories
bawled forth, chests and gold to be stared at, rum to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
swigged. Crawford looked at the loot and turned away
with a cool shrug, exchanged a glance with Frontin, and
found Vanderberg tugging at his sleeve and squinting at
the two craft.</p>

<p>“What men are those? Where did ye find ’em? The
ketch is a prize,” he said.</p>

<p>“Ay, a Bostonnais—a fur-pirate, blown out of her
course by storm. When her cap’n and officers were pistoled,
she gave in,” said Crawford. “Eleven men left
alive aboard her who are glad enough to go pirating
under Vanderberg or Crawford. On the bark I have
eight Irishmen who care naught for Vanderberg but much
for Crawford.”</p>

<p>“Damme and sink me!” roared Vanderberg delightedly,
and smote him between the shoulders. “Come down to
the cabin and talk in peace.”</p>

<p>They went below and settled about the table, leaving
the eager men to smash the mahogany chests with axes.
Frontin brought what was left of the Spanish wine, and
a rare old drink it was; Crawford made his own tale brief,
and listened to Vanderberg’s tale, and presently Bose
came down to hear, fists full of gold and a wide grin on
his face. The other men drifted down by ones and twos,
until they were all crowded into the cabin and some with
gold bars, others with coin found in one of the chests.</p>

<p>Crawford sipped at the Spanish wine but refused to
drink heavily. In his manner was a certain constraint, a
cold and imperturbable air of waiting; as he listened to
Vanderberg’s ranting about roaming the Indies with his
squadron and mayhap taking aboard more men and sacking
some Spanish town on the main, a smile tugged at his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
lips and his blue eyes glinted frostily. Presently this
mien of his impinged upon Vanderberg’s perception, so
that the captain turned to him with an oath.</p>

<p>“What’s in you, Crawford? Hast no warmth in life?
Come, down with the wine and we’ll go aboard the bark
and take possession.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said Crawford. “Our ways part here.”</p>

<p>Now Vanderberg stared at him, and Bose and the men
stared, and a moment of heavy silence settled upon them
all. But Frontin’s smile grew more saturnine.</p>

<p>“What d’ye mean?” growled Vanderberg, meeting the
icy stab of those blue eyes.</p>

<p>“The bark’s new and uncommon stout,” said Crawford
quietly. “No better ship could be found to batter ice. The
ketch is near as large as this craft of yours and an even
better sailer. I’ve put no lack of supplies aboard her;
indeed, I took her for your use. Move your guns into her
and head south or to the devil. I’ll take the bark, with
my eight Irish and five of the English who want to fare
with me to Hudson Bay——”</p>

<p>Vanderberg’s eyes blazed. “Eh? Take the bark? I
say you shall not.” And his big fist crashed down on the
table, while the men around uttered blasphemous approval.
Vanderberg bawled at the men for silence, reduced
himself to calmness by an effort, and turned to
Crawford.</p>

<p>“Hark’ee!” said he, leaning forward over the table and
giving look for look. “One thing ye forgot. All of us are
sworn to certain articles. Any of us may quit the ship
whenever he chooses; but company property’s another
thing. The bark belongs to all of us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>“Ay!” chimed up a chorus of voices. But Crawford
laughed a little.</p>

<p>“Who’s sworn? Not I. To perdition with your buccaneering
articles! As for the bark beings yours—who
took her? I did, and I mean to have her. But listen, all
of ye! I’ll be fair. What’s my share of that gold up
above?”</p>

<p>“One third to Frontin as discoverer,” said the Captain
promptly. “The rest in shares. Five to me, two to each
officer, one to each man. We voted you an extra
share.”</p>

<p>“You are generous, and I thank you,” said Crawford
drily. “But I’ll turn back my three shares and take the
bark instead. How’s that, lads? Vote on it!”</p>

<p>There was a howl of dissent at this, and Vanderberg
grinned nastily. He had viewed that bark with a seaman’s
eye, as had they all, and had found her better than
good. Then a sudden thought struck him.</p>

<p>“Why did ye not run with her when ye had her, Crawford?”</p>

<p>Crawford shrugged lightly.</p>

<p>“Why? What I want I take—I don’t steal. Bose, will
ye go to the bay with me?”</p>

<p>“Nay, sink me if I will!” cried out the big ruffian
swiftly. “To a land of ice where devils play all the Winter,
and there’s but a week i’ the year a ship can pass the
straits? Not me!”</p>

<p>Crawford looked at Frontin, but the latter made no
sign. So he sent his gaze again to Vanderberg, and what
he read in the latter’s face told him there was storm ahead.</p>

<p>“Take the ketch, Crawford,” said Vanderberg, grasping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
at this bright thought. “Ye could not work the bark with
so few men, anyhow. Take the ketch, and what ye will
of the stores. How’s that, lads?”</p>

<p>“Ay!” roared up the sudden yell, but Crawford only
smiled frostily at them.</p>

<p>“I take the bark,” said he quietly.</p>

<p>“Settle it as ye will,” said Frontin, laughing, and caught
a mug from the table. “I’m up above for a dram.”</p>

<p>He worked his way through the crowd, none heeding
him, and vanished up the ladder that led to the deck.</p>

<p>“Crawford, be reasonable!” growled Vanderberg, with
a ponderous oath. “The bark ye shall not have—so say
we all.”</p>

<p>“She has three guns trained on you,” said Crawford
coolly. “Perhaps you noticed how she was moored?
She’ll blow you all to hell and the gold with you, if I
come not back.”</p>

<p>Now, at any other time this threat would have won the
day, for none doubted that it would be carried out. As
it happened, however, the men who had returned with
Bose were drunk with exultation and hot raw rum and the
touch of gold; and those with Vanderberg were worn to
the quick with mad drinking and madder work, so that
at a dare they would all of them have attacked the devil
and his angels.</p>

<p>Too late, Crawford saw that his main petard had failed
to explode. Ugly grins ran along the circle of black and
bronzed and bearded faces, and an uglier murmur; hands
went fumbling to knives, and men drew closer together
before the companionway. Vanderberg showed his great
yellow teeth in a grin of sneering anger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>“Ye think that bullies of the main are adread of a
shotted gun or two? Ye poor simpleton!”</p>

<p>A wild outburst of laughter went up at this, and devilry
was in the laughter. For a moment rang out scurrilous
jests and oathy jibes; but as Crawford sat unmoving and
quite cool, and as his frosty blue eyes swept them from
man to man with a calm unconcern, they presently
quieted. Not that they were abashed, however.</p>

<p>“Traitor!” spat a negro, and others caught up the word.</p>

<p>Now they were dangerous, for steel was out; they were
persuaded against him in their hearts, and murder came
close to the surface. Nor could it be avoided. Massed
against him, Vanderberg with them, they had no fear of
him now. They were on three sides of him, Bose and the
captain at the table, his back to the wall of the cabin.
There was a large stern window, but the glass had been
smashed and a cloth nailed over it.</p>

<p>Now an irresolute silence. Vanderberg put out a hand
and gulped down what was left of the Spanish wine; it
mixed ill with rum, for his cheeks fired red at once. Then
he cocked his head, listening. In the silence came a
squeaking from above, as of a block and tackle at work;
but this was instantly forgotten, when Crawford played
his last and most desperate card.</p>

<p>He drew two pistols from under his coat and laid them
on the table, and calmly primed them with a pinch of
powder.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” he said coolly, “we fail to agree. The
one determining factor must be hot lead, if ye’ll have it
so. So far as my share of the gold is concerned, I’ll give
it to the fellows aboard the ketch who want to join you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
but the bark is mine. I’m going back to her. Any of you
lads want to ship with me?”</p>

<p>“We’d ship wi’ the foul fiend sooner,” muttered one of
them.</p>

<p>Crawford laughed.</p>

<p>“You’ll do that if ye try to stop me, lads. Careful,
cap’n! Here are two pistols, and ye have none. I’ll——”</p>

<p>“Your high hand has gripped too far this time!” bawled
Vanderberg, and shoved back his chair. “Stop him,
lads! Give him the steel.”</p>

<p>Even before the word was spoken, the surging movement
of men began, and Crawford knew there was no
more hope. Therefore, he acted.</p>

<p>With one movement he lifted the heavy table with his
knees, threw his shoulder against it, and hurled it back
upon Vanderberg and the men. One of them plunged at
him with knife ready, and Crawford’s pistol roared in his
very face. Over his body Crawford leaped for the ladder,
and shot down with his second pistol a negro in his way.
Then he was upon the ladder.</p>

<p>The hand of the dying negro clamped upon his ankle.</p>

<p>A long howl, as of ravening beasts, filled the cabin; the
men hurtled forward, knives out, fighting each other to
get at the tripped figure. The empty pistols smashed in
their faces, but they gripped him, they had him down,
they dragged him back from the ladder and seethed above
him in a wild tangle of fighting shapes. In that confined
space the reek of powder went to their lungs and brains.
They were no longer men, but blood-scenting beasts, each
of them striving only to sink his knife into the man who
had dared them. The powder-smoke rolled up to the ceiling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
and back down upon them, blinding everything, creating
an obscurity that was hideous with yells and the
spreading stink of raw blood. Man slashed man indiscriminately.
The roaring bellow of Vanderberg was
drowned in yells and maddened oaths.</p>

<p>In one corner the twisting mass of men disintegrated.
Crawford, writhing from the heart of the blind fury, came
to one knee, knife and tomahawk in hand. A Frenchman
screamed out horribly. Coming to his feet, Crawford
dimly beheld the hulking figure of Bose rushing at him;
he slipped aside, struck out with the deadly tomahawk,
felt the blade sink in between ear and shoulder. Neck
half severed, dead in his stride, Bose pitched forward
headlong at the cloth covering the window, burst it away,
lingered limply for an instant over the sill, and then
lurched through the smashed frame and was gone. The
morning sunlight streamed in across the reek of powder.</p>

<p>Crawford plunged for the window, seeing there his one
chance of getting clear. He was at it, had a hand at the
opening, when a man swung into him full force, hurled him
aside, drove at him with a knife. They went down together,
and now the pack was upon him once more with
shrill yells as the new flood of light betrayed their prey.</p>

<p>Again Crawford rose, back to window, and cut with
knife and axe at the ringing faces. Knives bit back; blood
was streaming from him in a dozen places. Then, flailing
his way through the midst of them, splitting the serried
rank asunder, came Vanderberg, whirling in both hands
a leg from the wrecked table. He whirled and struck.
Crawford ducked the blow, the club struck the cabin
wall—and the tomahawk left Crawford’s hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>Too slow! Vanderberg interposed the club, and the
steel glanced. Again the table-leg swung; as it fell, Crawford
darted inside the blow, though the force of it jarred
him to the heels, and struck out with his knife. The point
raked across Vanderberg’s brow, no more, and from one
side came a thrown knife that struck Crawford over the
temple, but haft first. He threw out his arms, caught at
the cabin wall, fell to one knee, crouched.</p>

<p>A wild howl roared up, and the men surged in on him.
Then, under their very hands and knives, he sprang. The
leap took him upward, sent him head first through the
window-opening, banged his hips against the frame—and
he was gone.</p>

<p>Meantime, regardless of the raging tumult down below,
Frontin had been hard at work on deck. He got his dram
of rum, then he clapped on the companion-hatch and stoppered
it. Moving with incredible agility, he went to the
smashed mahogany chests, filled two of them with the
scattered gold bars, whipped slings around them, and drew
in the block and tackle, still reeved, which had brought
them aboard.</p>

<p>One by one he lowered them into the boat lying alongside.
From the men crowded at the rail of bark and ketch,
who had heard the two pistol-shots, were coming angry
shouts and queries, but Frontin only waved his hand at
them and followed the chests down into the boat. This
was a perilous matter, since now she rode heavily, but he
put an oar from the stern and began to scull. He went,
not toward the other craft nor the shore, but along the side
of the <i>Irondelle</i> to the stern, where he waited.</p>

<p>He was still waiting there, a twisted grin upon his thin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
lips, anxiety in his glittering eyes, when Crawford dropped
all asprawl into the water. An instant later Frontin was
bending above the spot, while heads crowded through the
stern window above and yells roared at him. He grinned,
waved his hand. They watched, wondering at his purpose
there.</p>

<p>The wonder was soon flamed into wild rage when they
saw him pull the dripping figure of Crawford in over the
stern. Weak, half-conscious, yet wakened anew by his icy
immersion, Crawford came over the gunnel and managed
to drag himself to the thwart, as Frontin bent to the oar.
The yells of fury from above died away, for the boat shot
back around the side of the ketch.</p>

<p>“You came by the wrong road,” said Crawford, gasping.
“Why the devil didn’t you get ’em in the rear?
Sink me, man, I’d given up hope of help from you.”</p>

<p>Frontin fastened upon him a saturnine regard. Crawford
was looking up at the ship.</p>

<p>“I’m not a fool,” he said, “and I had no pistols. No
need to look up! The hatch is clapped on. I had to get
this gold of mine.”</p>

<p>Crawford glanced around at the chests, and broke into
a laugh. From the <i>Irondelle</i> came a hammering and
pounding, a wild roar of muffled voices.</p>

<p>“Now’s your chance,” said Frontin coolly. “Say the
word and I’ll slip aboard her, or call your men from the
bark. Touch fire to her, take the gold, and leave the dogs
to roast. Eh?”</p>

<p>“Plague take the gold, and them with it, you ruffian!”
said Crawford. He could feel the strength ebbing out of
him rapidly. “What brought you to aid me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>Frontin squinted at the bark, and made a slight gesture.</p>

<p>“The Star of Dreams,” said he, and laughed thinly.
“But tell me swiftly what you want me to do. I don’t
think you’re hurt to death, yet in another minute the blood
will be drained out of you——”</p>

<p>“Some of the English aboard the ketch will join me.
Get them. Set a course for the north. Tell Phelim not
to fire the guns——”</p>

<p>“And yonder ketch?”</p>

<p>“Leave her here—for Vanderberg.” Crawford uttered
a wild, swift laugh. “’Twas he and you gave the Star
into my hands. Then I was a homeless, destitute wanderer,
an escaped felon; now I’ve a stout ship, a heavy
lading, true friends to aid, and the Star of Dreams to lead
into the north—into the north, over the horizon—always
over the horizon! Ay, after all——”</p>

<p>“After all?” prompted Frontin, as the words failed
weakly.</p>

<p>“After all, Vanderberg made only one mistake—he—he
opposed the—destiny of—the Star of—Dreams——”</p>

<p>Crawford’s head drooped, and he pitched forward off
the thwart, senseless. But Frontin, rapidly working the
oar, glanced down at the reddening body with a thin
smile.</p>

<p>“Nay, nay!” he murmured. “That talk will do for
fools, but not for me. Where poor Vanderberg made his
mistake, was in opposing the destiny of Harry Crawford!
<i>En avant</i>—the Star goes north, and I follow it. Immortality
awaits us; whether we gain immortality by pike-thrust,
bullet, or frost, what matter?”</p>

<p>He shrugged a little, then dropped his oar and deftly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
caught the line flung to him by Sir Phelim Burke of Murtha.</p>

<p>Ten minutes afterward, the bark was standing out of
the cove toward the ice blink on the north horizon.</p>

EVEN IN A WILDERNESS, ONE CANNOT ESCAPE THE DEVIL</h3>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">If</span> your Star Woman lies this way, cap’n,” said
Frontin, “devil take me if I want to find her! This
ice—ah! A shot in this wilderness? Was that a
gunshot or an ice-creak?”</p>

<p>Crawford seized his arm, stood listening. “A shot, true
enough! Dead ahead of us. Bear to the left, I’ll bear to
the right. Watch yourself!”</p>

<p>The two men separated.</p>

<p>Although it was August and the wide expanse of Hudson
Bay was now open water, all the winter’s freeze was
thrust here at the straits for exit, and not a ship had entered.
No ship could fight this frozen sea until the jam
burst. August, indeed? Here at the straits the very
word was intolerable mockery.</p>

<p>Here nothing was in sight but ice and fog. The
heavens above, the earth beneath, the waters under the
earth, were all congealed into dead greyness; there was
not even the blue shimmer of sun-struck bergs. Everything
was unreal. The ear was assailed by a low, unceasing
groan, which now rose into a crescendo of unearthly
crashes and shrieks and again rolled in dim reverberant
thunders, felt rather than heard; this came from
the ice, floes and small bergs and crushed mountains hanging
at crazy angles, all hurled into one inchoate mass by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
the tremendous urge of the bay waters trying to crowd
through the narrow straits to the sea.</p>

<p>In the air was that bitter and penetrating chill which
comes of melting floes—a chill mocking at furs, thrusting
into the very heart and entrails of the two men who appeared
and vanished again, crawling across that drear expanse.
To the northwest, hidden among the white masses,
the position of the bark <i>Northstar</i> was marked by a thread
of smoke two miles away; even this smoke looked cold
and shivery as it wound shuddering into the sky and fog.
To east and south rose the steep and awful cliffs of Cape
Digge and the strait; they ran, ice-dripping, into heaven
and melted in the horizon fog, cold barriers set two thousand
feet in air to keep the inland sea cloaked in thin mist
and bitter chill. Digge’s Island was a dim blur; to west
and south were grinding, crushing bergs and floes. Overhead
was dun sunlight drowned in high fog—a ghastly
and unearthly fog which threatened to close down again
in an hour or two and add its clammy fingers to the merciless
grip of the ice.</p>

<p>“The shot came from about here,” called Crawford,
giving a hallo to which none answered. He paused on a
rounded hummock to sweep the surrounding surface with
his gaze. From his left, where Frontin was toiling among
upflung masses of rough ice, broke a sudden sharp cry.</p>

<p>“Here we are, cap’n! Name of the saints—come and
look!”</p>

<p>Turning, Crawford hastened to join his lieutenant,
scrambling over pinnacles and avoiding pools of melted
water. Frontin, poised on a ridge of broken masses, uttered
a curt comment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“No hurry. He’s dead, or I’m a liar!”</p>

<p>Cursing the bitter chill, Crawford climbed up beside this
tall and saturnine comrade and friend, this Frontin of the
cynical air and the warm heart. Reaching the ridge, he
found himself looking down at a hollow, an icepan closed
in all around by crushed pinnacles, like an open glade in
a forest. Below the two men, at the near side of this hollow,
lay the outstretched shape of a huge white bear, the
top of its head blown away—and beside this, the motionless
figure of a man, apparently an Eskimo, lying across
a gun.</p>

<p>“These Eskimos have no fusils and don’t use powder,”
said Crawford, for despite his astonishment, his brain was
quickly at work. “Yet—where could he have come from?
Certainly no ship has come ahead of us—the Eskimos told
us that much. One might have followed us into the
straits——”</p>

<p>Frontin waved his hand at the ice around.</p>

<p>“One or a dozen. We ha’ been carried in the ice for
weeks, up one channel and down another—ah! I see that
heaven has declared me a liar.” He moved suddenly.
“The man’s not dead after all.”</p>

<p>The two clambered down, leaping and sliding into the
hollow where the ice was pooled with blood. Frontin
turned the man over, lifted head to lap, tenderly soothed
the poor hurt and disemboweled thing that had been human
before the claws of the bear ripped so deep and far.
The man’s eyelids fluttered open, and his vacant gaze fell
upon Crawford. He spoke feebly in English.</p>

<p>“The smoke—the smoke! It is a sure sign; I tell you,
haste and slay them—no parley, no hesitation! No quarter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
to man or woman. English or French, slay them or
they will kill us all. That smoke means a ship. I—I—ah!
You—you are not Moses Deakin! Who are you?”</p>

<p>Intelligence leaped into those eyes, a last flicker of fast-dying
fires.</p>

<p>“Where are you from?” demanded Crawford imperatively.
“Your ship? Where is she?”</p>

<p>“Blast you to hell and sink you lower!” was the response.
“Ho, Moses—Moses Deakin! No quarter to
them—no quarter——”</p>

<p>That was all. The hurt thing was at peace.</p>

<p>Now silence fell upon the two men—silence of wondering
and slow comprehension. Frontin rose, turned his
dark and glittering gaze upon the empty white desert surrounding
them; his saturnine, hawk-nosed visage was
wrinkled in perplexity. Crawford began to stuff tobacco
into his pipe and stared down at the dead man, his wide
and heavy-lidded eyes veiled thoughtfully. Frost and
bleak winds had darkened the thin lines of nose and cheek
and chin since he had left Newfoundland behind him,
only to intensify their hard and aggressive determination.</p>

<p>Whence had this man come? No other ships had come
through the roaring turmoil of the straits, according to the
Eskimos. For weeks the <i>Northstar</i> had been carried back
and forth and roundabout in the grip of ice and fog and
currents, now out almost to open water, now back in the
straits with the drift. Yet the presence of this man
showed that some other ship was at hand, and any other
ship spelled peril of the utmost to Hal Crawford.</p>

<p>Here in the bitter north, as on the golden main to the
south, powder was the only lawgiver. During a generation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
and more, English, French and Bostonnais had disputed
for possession of Hudson’s great bay and its beaver
trade. A year previously, the English Company of Adventurers
had swept the French from the bay posts; what
would happen this year or the next, no man could predict.
The Iroquois war whoop had resounded from the
dark pines these ten years, meeting at the apex of a great
overland triangle the scalp-yell of the Sioux. The heroic
Danish colony had perished in mad horror years ago.
Freebooters and fur-pirates slipped in through the straits
and out again before the ice formed. Here only the fittest
could survive; the conquered met with no quarter, whether
from man or from nature.</p>

<p>“Queer words, cap’n,” said Frontin reflectively. “He
was repeating something that he had previously said. He
must have seen our smoke. H’m! Then he would not
have shot the bear unless forced to it. He was scouting
us, eh? The bear attacked him, they killed each
other——”</p>

<p>“Ay,” said Crawford, opening his firebag.</p>

<p>“No quarter, quoth he,” resumed Frontin. “Death of
my life! There is nothing in sight, though his ship may
be hidden like ours. That name of Moses Deakin—a
singular name! Have ye ever heard it before?”</p>

<p>“Ay,” said Crawford again.</p>

<p>Frontin turned and gazed curiously at him, while he
fumbled with flint and steel. Presently he had the tinder
aglow—and abruptly he pinched it out. A sudden blaze
swept into his steel-blue eyes. He hastily thrust away
pipe and firebag.</p>

<p>“I have it—quick, now!” he exclaimed sharply. “Two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
men were out together, even as we are. Moses Deakin
left this man, started back to their ship. He’ll have heard
the gunshot and will return to see what it means. Back,
out of sight! It’s our chance to catch him—and if we
catch Moses Deakin we have the best prize on the bay.
Back, back! Prime the guns and wait!”</p>

<p>Frontin paused not to reason why, but slid away and
vanished among the hummocks above. Crawford stooped
over the dead man and explored beneath the torn, frozen-red
garments. His hand came away with a crinkle of
paper, and he gave the document one sharp look that
widened his eyes. Then he hastily turned the body face
down as it had first lain, and followed his lieutenant into
hiding. No footsteps had left any trace on the ice. Here
was death and nothing else.</p>

<p>Crouched beside Frontin among the hummocks, Crawford
briefly told what he knew of this Moses Deakin.</p>

<p>“A Boston fur-pirate; I heard queer tales of him both
in New York and Boston. They say he’s a great, hard,
cold devil who sees visions, has dealings with the foul
fiend and is cruel as any Mohawk. It is supposed that he
has a secret post somewhere on the bay and agents among
the Indians; he sneaks in and gets his furs when the
straits open, and goes again swiftly. This is rumour, but
he’s reality. Either the French or the English would blow
him out of the water if they could catch him at work—he’s
done them both a deal of harm.”</p>

<p>“We don’t care for furs,” said Frontin. “Then why is
he of value to us?”</p>

<p>“Because they say he knows the bay as no other man
does—every river and shallow of it. That’s how he eludes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
capture. You comprehend? If we catch him, we find the
northwest passage and the south sea beyond.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Frontin thoughtfully, “I thought you had
been tempted by the Star Woman, of whom Iberville told
you!”</p>

<p>“An Indian legend, a wild dream!” Crawford’s tone
was impatient. “If nothing better offered, I’d chance it—but
not if we can catch Moses Deakin and find the northwest
passage!”</p>

<p>Frontin shrugged. The two men now waited silent,
motionless; from their position no moving object could
be seen, but this meant little. Except from some high elevation,
a man or a dozen men could not be sighted among
these heaped-up masses of ice. Then, suddenly, Frontin
touched Crawford’s elbow. Among the opposite crags of
ice, across the hollow, appeared a moving shape which
came abruptly into full view and paused to look down
upon the scene of death. A great and grim man was this,
whose entire bearing conveyed a singular impression of
iron resolution and dominance.</p>

<p>A fur cap covered his head. Merging with the shaggy
fur, an immense beard of grizzled black swept across his
lower face and hung in two bushy prongs over his barrel
of a chest. Between cap and beard were visible a massive,
wide-nostriled nose and two most remarkable eyes. They
were deeply set and far apart, beneath shaggy grizzled
brows; they were extremely large, insolent, commanding,
of a light and steely gray which contrasted strongly with
the mass of jet hair. Across his shoulders lay a fusil,
which he now suddenly lifted and fired in air.</p>

<p>“A signal!” breathed Frontin. “Now is our time——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>“No—no!” denied Crawford, his low word desperately
urgent. “Look! We are lost——”</p>

<p>The gunshot had been answered by a burst of calls and
shouts, so unexpected and so close that both watchers
started. At once other men came into view, half a dozen
of them, along the opposite ridge of ice. In a flash Crawford
perceived his frightful error of calculation. The dead
man had been companioned, not by Deakin alone, but by
all these others!</p>

<p>Crawford met the crisis after his usual fashion. Setting
his mouth to Frontin’s ear, ignoring the group who were
swiftly descending the opposite slope toward the bodies
of man and bear, he spoke rapidly.</p>

<p>“Keep my gun, stay hidden; be ready for anything.
If I go with them, watch and get a bearing on where their
ship lies. Keep the smoke-flare going from the bark.
You comprehend? They know all about us, we know
nothing about them. Here—take care of this paper.”</p>

<p>Into Frontin’s hand he thrust the paper taken from the
dead man; then he rose and strode forward. He was
apparently unarmed, knife and tomahawk being hidden.</p>

<p>As Crawford thus swung into their sight, descending
from the icy ridge to the hollow, the group of men stared
at him for half a moment in gaping amazement. Then
their guns swung up, but he spoke out with a cool assurance
that gave them pause.</p>

<p>“Careful, Cap’n Deakin, careful! You’re outnumbered
and have stumbled into a very neat ambuscade.
Ho, Frontin! Bid one of the men to fire in the air, that
our good Moses may realize his position.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>“Ay, cap’n,” responded Frontin’s voice, followed by
the roar of a fusil in air.</p>

<p>Astounded by the appearance of Crawford, finding
themselves apparently surrounded by hidden foes as they
huddled there in the ice-hollow, the half-dozen Boston
men dared not move. They crowded around Moses Deakin,
who was measuring Crawford with his bold, hard
gaze. Startled though he was, the fur-pirate was unafraid.</p>

<p>“Well?” he demanded truculently. “Who the devil
may you be, that you know my name?”</p>

<p>Crawford, suiting action to utterance, surveyed him
with a slight and whimsical smile.</p>

<p>“My dear Deakin,” he responded calmly, “we ought
to know you, since we’ve had men posted around your ship
since last night! If we bore you any ill will, we might
have taken that craft of yours a dozen times over. But
to what end? As the redskins say, I’m bringing you a belt
of white wampum and a calumet. Agree to a truce, and
I’ll go over to your ship with you and have a friendly
talk.”</p>

<p>“Your name?” growled Deakin, obviously taken all
aback.</p>

<p>“Crawford.”</p>

<p>“Blood and wounds! Not Hal Crawford, the pirate?”
cried Deakin, while his men gaped and stared at hearing
the name.</p>

<p>“So called. Come—is it peace or war? Give your
word; I’ll accept it.”</p>

<p>Deakin was not the sort to hesitate when trapped.
He put out his hand and advanced, giving Crawford a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
mighty grip. He made answer with apparent heartiness,
yet with a ruthless treachery thinly veiled in those
domineering eyes of his.</p>

<p>“Ay! Come aboard with us; peace it is, cap’n. To
the ship, lads, and out o’ this! The flood tide be lifting
this accursed ice. Leave the corpse where it is.”</p>

<p>Crawford turned and lifted his voice. “Frontin! Take
the men back to the ship and signal in all the crew. If I
do not return in three hours, come over the ice and hang
Moses Deakin.”</p>

<p>“Ay, cap’n,” the unseen Frontin made reply.</p>

<p>Deakin showed huge yellow teeth through his beard at
this threat, then rumbled out a laugh and turned. He set
off for the southeast with Crawford beside him, while the
men draggled after them and cast frightened glances at
the desolate expanse of ice, now cracking and groaning
and heaving from the rise of water below. No word was
spoken. Since the hour lay close upon noon, Crawford
guessed that the Bostonnais and his men were hungry.</p>

<p>So far, so good, he reflected. Whether he could carry
through the bluff was of no great consequence; he scarcely
even thought of the issue. Since he dared not betray his
real ignorance by asking any questions, he accompanied
Deakin in silence until he made out a tracery of spars lying
ahead. Presently he discovered that the fur-pirate lay
barely three miles away from the <i>Northstar</i>, in under the
frowning cliffs of the mainland and close to the great cape
itself.</p>

<p>Closer approach showed the Boston ship to be a large
square-rigged corvette carrying three heavy guns to a
side; by name, the <i>Albemarle</i>. When he found that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
Deakin had nearly thirty men aboard his rover, Crawford
grimaced at thought of his little bark with her crew of
fourteen. Presently they were up the side of the ice-gripped
corvette, and Crawford followed his host aft to
the main cabin. A wild, shaggy crew of men they were
who stared at him, and scurvy had brushed some of them
with its hideous hand.</p>

<p>Once down below, Crawford seated himself alone with
Deakin, and a lanky boy fetched them pannikins of food
and mugs of grog. A boatswain entered and asked for
orders; Deakin gave them curtly, crisply, and dipped
fingers in pannikin again. Crawford perceived that while
this man was uncouth as any bear, he yet possessed
strange depths of bravery, treachery, perhaps madness.</p>

<p>“And now to talk!” Deakin swigged his rum, accepted
the tobacco Crawford offered, and made a light. “What
force have ye? Half down with scurvy, I’ll warrant.”</p>

<p>“Force enough, and not a touch of scurvy so far.”</p>

<p>“That’s a lie,” was the blunt response. Crawford’s
blue eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>“Softly, Master Deakin! Once for that word is enough.
Any more of it and I’ll put steel into you! Guard your
tongue better. Who was that man mangled by the bear?”</p>

<p>“My lieutenant.” Deakin gazed unwinkingly at his visitor.
In his bold stare lay a more deadly menace than that
which Crawford had just put into voice. “Had been
three year with me. What sort o’ ship have ye got?”</p>

<p>“A bark.” Crawford put the light to his pipe and
puffed. “I’m no pirate, as ye miscall me. I’ve no interest
in furs or gain. I’m looking for the place that’s over the
horizon, and count on getting help from you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>The shaggy brows drew down. “What place is it,
then?”</p>

<p>“Whatever may be there.” Crawford coolly put his
hand inside his shirt, and drew out the Star of Dreams
that hung on its thong. At sight of it, Deakin’s eyes
opened wide. “The star, Cap’n Deakin—my star of
dreams! I follow the sign. Call it a madman’s fancy,
if ye like; I seek only freedom, clear action, a chance to
be myself. I’m sick of the struggle for pelf and place and
power—I want a fresher world. I have goods and provisions
and gold aboard the bark, and need to rob naught
from other men. If others—mark it well!—think to rob
me, I have teeth and can use ’em.”</p>

<p>“Others have teeth, for that matter,” said Moses Deakin,
and those big eyes of his narrowed slightly as Crawford
thrust away the star. “Blood and wounds! How
d’ye expect me to believe such a tale? Who comes into
these seas, but for furs?”</p>

<p>“I do, for one,” was the cool response. “You have
reason—use it! If I wanted loot, what easier than to
take your ship? Then to seek that hidden trading post
of yours and loot it. But that’s nonsense—we have no
quarrel. Here’s what I want of you: Is it true, as pilots
say, that from the northwest of this bay a passage leads
to the south seas?”</p>

<p>Deakin frowned upon his questioner. His eyes glimmered
in a way that Crawford misliked; they glinted with
suspicion, with crafty search, with a slow and heavy
pondering.</p>

<p>“Not to my knowledge,” he made answer at length,
“and I should know if any man does. Last year the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
French ships drove me far up to the nor’west, where I
talked with Injuns. This folly of a south sea passage
means naught.”</p>

<p>So positive was Deakin’s tone, so filled with assured
conviction were his words, that Crawford could not but
feel in this moment that he had been following a false
trail. Deakin should know—that was true. If Deakin
said no passage existed, then it might well be accepted as
a fact.</p>

<p>While Crawford puffed in frowning silence, however,
Deakin now continued with an abrupt change of topic
and manner.</p>

<p>“What’s to hinder me keeping you here while my men
go take your ship? There’s two hundred pound for you
in Boston, dead or alive. You ha’ gold aboard, and supplies
that are worth more than gold in these parts. What’s
to hinder, eh?”</p>

<p>Crawford’s thin lips emitted a thin cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>“Try it and see. What’s two hundred pound and the
loot of a bark, as against a winter’s stock o’ furs? A poor
gamble, Cap’n Deakin. My men would give you as good
as they got.”</p>

<p>Deakin’s teeth shone through his beard, and his eyes
smouldered darkly. “I’ll swallow no such tale of a
south sea passage. H’m! You’ve not been i’ the bay before,
neither; but what about Frontin, your lieutenant—eh?
Ay, I’ve heard of that French pirate! And sink
me, but that explains it well enough, that does!”</p>

<p>“Explains what?” asked Crawford, somewhat astonished
by these heavy ruminations.</p>

<p>“Your being here. No doubt Frontin caught some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
thread o’ the tale; likely, the French Company’s men
heard it from the redskins. And you’re just fool enough
to go look into it. Fool! H’m! You and your star—honest
enough in that folly, too! Ye did wrong to show
me that star, for I have a nose to scent with. Warlock,
that’s what ye are, and I can see it all now. You have
heard the tale, but so have I.”</p>

<p>“Eh?” Crawford was suddenly alert, as the dog who
scents unseen game. “What tale?”</p>

<p>“The Star Woman, o’ course!”</p>

<p>With an air of irritated finality, as though he had found
the answer to a troublous problem, Deakin lifted his mug
and drained it. He banged down the pewter, licked his
hairy lips, grunted savagely. Then he continued, his gaze
fastened on Crawford.</p>

<p>“Ay, the Star Woman! Makes ye jump, eh? I’ve
guessed it, sure enough. Little you know of her, though;
while I’ve seen her—if not in the flesh, then otherwise.
No white man has seen her in the flesh, and few enough
o’ the red devils; oh, ye cunning liar! It’s not nor’west
that you’re seeking, but west and south. Well, whilst
French and English are there, neither you nor I will do
much looking in that direction. Dost know there’s a host
of ships behind us in the straits, icebound?”</p>

<p>“Ships?” repeated Crawford, catching swiftly at the
more essential news despite his amazed wonder at the
man’s talk of the Star Woman. “How d’ye know?”</p>

<p>“Why, I saw them, as I saw the Star Woman. French
ships o’ the line, English frigates—bah! Come up on
deck and talk in the open air. Plague upon this stuffy
cabin!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>Moses Deakin shoved back his chair and rose. Crawford
accompanied him to the ladder, still lost in marvel
at what he had heard. At the ladder, Deakin motioned
him to mount.</p>

<p>Then, as Crawford’s back was turned, Moses Deakin
threw up his arm and struck. The blow, sharp and light
but deadly as an arrow, drove home to the base of the
brain. Crawford fell against the ladder, then rolled down,
paralyzed.</p>

<p>So there, it seemed, the Star of Dreams had led but to
an ill fortune.</p>

<p>While these things chanced aboard the <i>Albemarle</i>, and
the day dragged on, Frontin was heavily making his way
back to his own ship. He did not regain the <i>Northstar</i>
until afternoon; and if there was dismay in his own heart,
he brought stark consternation to those aboard her.</p>

<p>It was a strangely diverse company that grouped around
him to hear the tale he spat out between bites of food.
The six Englishmen were hardy rascals who cared only
that they should never see an English gaol again, following
Crawford with blind infatuation. The eight Irishmen
followed Crawford largely because Sir Phelim Burke did
so, since they loved Phelim beyond measure. Only one of
them could speak or write English.</p>

<p>“I sighted her ship and got bearings on her,” concluded
Frontin. “Can lead ye there in the dark, for she’s fast in
shore ice; but what use? I saw that big bear of a man
come up from below alone, roar at his men, and shake his
fist toward us. The cap’n is trapped and gone.”</p>

<p>Sir Phelim Burke uttered a low groan of despair, and
turned to stare helplessly at the fog which clamped them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
in. They stood on the maindeck—there was no frost in
the air, only the chill of melting ice. The <i>Northstar</i>,
rigged in the fashion which another twenty years was to
know as “schooner,” lay grappled to a small berg. She
was a new ship of oak, and the ice-battering had not so
much as started a butt in her. Yet Frontin, as he drearily
climbed aboard, had noted something which started his
brain to frantic work.</p>

<p>Within the past half-hour fog had come down—heavy,
cloaking mist that lay about them like an evil thing.
Through it penetrated the groaning of the floes; even the
berg beside them was filled with long heavings and shudderings
and queer noises. The ice was all in movement,
as it moved each day at high tide, now back and now
forth, in a slow and regular motion with the varying trend
of shore-currents and ice-drift. Blocked by the huge
jam across the mouth of the straits, these outer masses
were gradually disintegrating.</p>

<p>“Say the word, Master Frontin,” spoke up one of the
Englishmen, “and we be off with ye. We’ll not let the
cap’n bide on yon ship without a fight.”</p>

<p>Frontin gave him a bleak look. “Go aloft, Dickon, and
keep sharp watch. The fog has come down low, and up
above it thins quickly. Watch sharp for the direction of
the drift.”</p>

<p>Dickon departed, and Frontin sent the other men to
sleep and rest. Sir Phelim dully repeated the order to his
Irish, and presently Frontin and Burke remained alone.</p>

<p>“What hope?” said Burke, despair in his branded,
weary countenance. “Even is Hal not dead, how can we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
help? I understand your meaning, Frontin. The ice is
moving us, and the fog has settled down. We cannot find
that accursed ship now.”</p>

<p>“I can find her in hell, when the time comes,” said
Frontin. He drained a mug of wine, wiped his lips, and
settled back against the rail. When he had a tinder-match
alight, he set it to his pipe and puffed comfortably.</p>

<p>“The cap’n is not dead, Sir Phelim, depend upon it! I
think that he gave this Deakin too large a tale—frightened
him. So Deakin caught him off guard and clamped
him in irons. Why? No doubt to serve as hostage. That
order to me, bidding me come over and hang Deakin unless
the cap’n returned, frightened the man, set him thinking.
This Deakin is no fool. He guessed that we could
not come over and hang him, or take his ship either.”</p>

<p>“Then what do you propose?”</p>

<p>“To do it, since he thinks we cannot,” said Frontin
coolly.</p>

<p>Burke regarded him steadily. “How can you find that
ship again?”</p>

<p>Frontin smiled his thin, sardonic smile. “We’ve calculated
the drift each day. The Bostonnais is inside the
drift by the shore ice, and will not move until the outer ice
has broken up or gone. There is no hurry. Perhaps this
Deakin will set out to scout our ship and discover her
position and strength. Sir Phelim, do you believe in
omens?”</p>

<p>Burke now regarded him with some uneasiness. There
was about this Frenchman, whose affection for Crawford
was beyond words, something deep and terrible; his manner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
held a gloomy exultation. Burke, being in despondent
mood, was ready to see misfortune in this or anything
else.</p>

<p>“Omens? Well—at times. But you spoke of Deakin
coming to scout our ship?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He will do it. He can find her.”</p>

<p>“But he will discover our weakness!”</p>

<p>Frontin snapped his fingers. “Let him. Now, return
to our omens! For example, that star which the cap’n
wears. You believe in that Star of Dreams?”</p>

<p>Burke smiled a sad and twisted smile.</p>

<p>“I believe in his belief, my dear Frontin. He and you
and I—we follow that star out of the world, over the
horizon; it is a symbol of the happiness that we have
never found, and will never find alive. It has led us here
to this desolate spot. Is that an omen? Then all this
damned and icebound northland is an omen, for we Irish
believe that hell is a place of snow and ice. Has this fog
a father? Out of whose womb came this ice, and who
has gendered the hoary frost of heaven?”</p>

<p>“We can dispense with poetry, which has a suspiciously
Biblical sound,” said Frontin drily. “Thank heaven I am
no Irishman, to make misfortunes into poetry! Instead,
I make them into a ladder.”</p>

<p>Sir Phelim laughed. “Poet yourself, dark man! Well,
why all this talk of omens and the star that we follow?”</p>

<p>“Because I propose to follow it now.”</p>

<p>For an instant Burke did not get the full import of
these words, until something in the tone, in the glinting
dark eyes, of Frontin gave him enlightenment. Then he
started.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>“Impossible! That were rank madness——”</p>

<p>Frontin lifted his hand, made an imperturbable gesture.
“Listen! Listen!”</p>

<p>The trembling grind of the crushing floes and bergs
had never ceased. As he listened, however, Sir Phelim
gradually detected a new and different sound—a strange
sound that blanched his weathered cheeks and widened
his eyes in horrified comprehension. This sound was a
slow and relentless groan which emanated from the very
heart of the bark herself. By some convergent pressure,
her timbers were being squeezed and ground between floes
and berg. A fraction of an inch at a time, she was being
crushed.</p>

<p>“We have a choice,” said Frontin coolly, when he saw
that the other understood. “We may stay here and fight,
blast holes in the ice, open a channel—and abandon the
cap’n. We cannot rescue both him and the ship. Time
presses, and we lack men.”</p>

<p>“But you would leave her, and all she contains?”</p>

<p>“Follow the star!” Frontin uttered a short, hard laugh.
“Follow the star, take that other ship——”</p>

<p>“Man, are you mad?” broke out Sir Phelim. “You
yourself have gold aboard here, and we cannot carry it
over the ice!”</p>

<p>“The devil gave the gold, let him take it again,” and
Frontin waved his pipe carelessly. “Do you love gold?
Neither do I. The Star of Dreams has gone aboard another
ship, and we follow. That is all. Her crew outnumbers
us, true, but they have no star.”</p>

<p>Burke frowned thoughtfully. “Yet the ice is moving.
There will be open channels to cross.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>“We shall take the small boat to cross them, then.
Listen! The movement has increased; all the ice outside
here is moving now. Perhaps we have reached the
end of this abominable delay! To-night we may either
be free of the ice, or again inclosed. However, I can find
that corvette.”</p>

<p>They were silent. That horrible squeezing groan of
wrenched oak was no longer to be heard. Perhaps the
pressure on the bark was relieved, perhaps the sound was
drowned in the increasing tumult from the fog-wrapped
ice all around. The tumult had become a cacaphony of
hideous noise. Out there in the fog the ice was heaving
up in great masses and falling again, bursting into fragments,
sliding and rending and crashing.</p>

<p>A hasty call from the man aloft brought Frontin to his
feet. He darted into the cabin for a spyglass, then
mounted the rigging. Sir Phelim Burke remained where
he was, lost in surmise. He knew that Frontin had
brought a mass of gold aboard the bark—was the Frenchman
ready to abandon this gold utterly? That bespoke
a greater love for Crawford than Burke had visioned in
the man, who was outwardly so bitter and cynical.</p>

<p>“Damn the ice! The plan is madness, madness manifold!”
Sir Phelim threw out his hands and gripped the
rail in despair, as he stared at the fog. “Heart of the
world gone wrong, and broken men adrift who pin faith
to a star and drive across the horizon, blindly! Well, I
think that this is not the first time men have trailed a star—but
they were wise men. We are fools, Hal Crawford,
and we love you—and are fools.”</p>

<p>Up above, Frontin was standing beside the pointing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
Dickon, incredulity in his face as he hurriedly focused his
glass. The sullen grinding and crashing of the ice had
come to a sudden pause, and the drift had ceased. That
drift had been to the northward. The fog, here little more
than ice-steam, did not lift but clung close down; up
above, however, there was a faint stir of wind which
helped to dissipate the upper layers of mist, stirring it all
into yeasty heavings.</p>

<p>From the masthead, Frontin could make out the line of
coast, or rather the cape, and calculated that the bark
had drifted two or three miles farther back toward the
straits. There in the north the fog was thicker and heavier,
a massive bank of greyness, now swirling away, now
parting for a moment, now abruptly closing again. Frontin
waited for another such shifting, his glass fastened toward
the end of the cape. The grey wall parted abruptly—parted
to disclose a tiny, fluttering bit of colour set in
its midst. Nothing else was to be seen save this scrap of
colour: the flag of England, set apparently in the sky and
fog. Then a sudden shrill cry burst from the man Dickon.</p>

<p>“Rot me—off to larboard, master! Look quick!”</p>

<p>Frontin swung around, and a low word broke from his
lips. A great eddy of the moving fogbank had blown an
open lane—a perfect channel through the mist, walled on
either hand. Looking down this lane, as though the scene
had been there set for his sight by some whimsy of the
invisible fingers which manipulated ice and fog and sea,
Frontin had one swift glimpse of a towering frigate, all
sail set, not three miles distant—and from her poop
drooped the white flag of France! Even as he looked,
the fog closed down again and she was gone like a dream-vision.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span> 
The English flag, over by the cape, had also
vanished. Frontin closed his glass and descended to the
deck, a touch of colour in his cheeks, his dark eyes aglow.
He came to Sir Phelim and clapped the latter on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Eh?” cried the startled Irishman. “What’s happened?
Ye look strange——”</p>

<p>“It’s what is about to happen!” and Frontin laughed
joyously. “Death of my life—who, think you, is out there
in the fog?”</p>

<p>“Crawford?”</p>

<p>“No—Iberville! His fleet must have followed us
through the straits. I saw the <i>Profound</i> lying out yonder
not a league distant; I ought to know the old brute of a
ship, since I once——” Here Frontin checked himself
and bit his lip, then continued more carefully. “She has
been under Iberville’s orders for two years, therefore the
rest of his fleet must be in the straits. And off the cape
is an English ship. Come! While the lions fight, the
jackals may seize the bone. To work! If we were sure
of heaven, we might tamely accept fate; but being minded
to stay out of hell as long as possible, we’ll fight. All
hands on deck! Sir Phelim, you and your Irishmen get
up food, rum or wine, and arms. Dickon, down from
aloft!”</p>

<p>Now Frontin, knowing that the ice movement had
halted with the tide, did a singular and characteristic
thing. In the galley was still smouldering a fire, whence
the smoke-signal had been drifting aloft all day. He ran
to it, seized the ends of brands and whipped them into the
embers, raked all the fire into a pot, crammed in some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
rotten canvas used for tinder, and with the flaming pot
aswing in his hand darted down the deck aft—and chucked
the whole thing into the stern cabins. Then he whirled
upon the shouting, startled men who thought him gone
mad, and his voice drove at them.</p>

<p>“Quick! Ships are close to us, all around us—an English
fleet! The bark’s being crushed i’ the ice; our only
hope is to get away and take the corvette that holds Cap’n
Crawford—swift, before the flames reach the powder!”</p>

<p>Cursing and shouting mad oaths, furious terror and
alarm plucking at them, the men scrambled to obey. Sir
Phelim whipped his Irish with crackling Gaelic words,
while Frontin got the other men at work swinging out the
tiny skiff from the stern, with the smoke rolling up from
below and the thought of powder-kegs to drive them with
the spur of necessity.</p>

<p>Now, as though to increase their mad frenzy of haste,
came out of the whole ship a frightful scream of twisted
oak. She began to move upward, slowly, as the ice nipped
and lifted her, started its work of rending through her
hull. Into the skiff went fusils and pistols and blades,
food and drink; one by one the men dropped to the ice,
seized ropes and made fast to the skiff, or lifted at her
bodily, each man cursing his neighbour to make more
haste. Then they drew away from the heaving, groaning
mass of timber, stumbling and slipping over the ice, following
the tall figure of Frontin and the shorter, limping
Phelim Burke.</p>

<p>So the fog closed around them.</p>

<p>After a little a ruddy brightness shone through the obscurity
in their rear, as the red flames leaped higher.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
After this had died and vanished behind the heavy curtain
of fog, came a sullen, booming detonation that shook the
great floes, flung the men all asprawl on the ice, and left
a frightful desolation in their hearts.</p>

<p>“Forward!” shouted Frontin, and they struggled up.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

WHEN FOG LIFTS, THE ROAD CLEARS</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> dazed and momentarily paralyzed by
the blow which felled him, Crawford did not quite
lose consciousness. He dimly realized that he was
being dragged back into the cabin by the Bostonnais; then
felt himself lifted and placed in a chair and firmly lashed
to it. Deakin rumbled with laughter.</p>

<p>“A good blow, one worth learning! You’re not hurt—come
around after a bit——”</p>

<p>Deakin stamped out and ascended to the deck above.</p>

<p>Sagging down in the chair with closed eyes, Crawford
relaxed utterly and rested while he might, wasting no
thought on his own carelessness; he had been caught, and
must face the future instead of the past. After a time his
senses cleared again and the agonized ache slowly passed
from his head and neck and nerve-centers, until presently
he dropped into a light doze. From this he was wakened
by a heavy trampling on deck, and heard the stentorian
tones of Deakin bellowed forth through a speaking
trumpet. Deakin had a voice like brass.</p>

<p>“Come back, come back!” roared the words, and again:
“Come back!”</p>

<p>So the Bostonnais was calling in his men. After a little
Crawford jerked up his head and came wide awake as
Deakin returned into the cabin.</p>

<p>“Ha! The ice be on the move again, and if those fools<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
o’ mine be not spry, they’ll get caught. Well, well—let’s
have your ’bacca.”</p>

<p>Stooping over his prisoner, Deakin swiftly searched him,
throwing weapons, pipe and tobacco pouch to the table,
and finally drawing forth the Star of Dreams on its thong.
During a long moment he hesitated over the emerald jewel,
greed fighting in his large eyes against a stronger fear;
then he reluctantly shoved it back beneath Crawford’s
shirt.</p>

<p>“Not that, not that!” he rumbled heavily. “There’s
wizardry in it, and I’ll ha’ no warlock after me o’ nights.
’Twas the star that brought ye here, yourself said it; and
Moses Deakin knows when to let things bide. Nay, I’ll
not touch the thing.”</p>

<p>With this astonishing speech the fur-pirate lowered himself
into his own chair, facing Crawford, stuffed his pipe
with the Virginia tobacco, and made a light. Crawford
held himself in check, realizing in a flash the singular
streak of superstition in his captor and resolving to see
whither it tended. Nor did Deakin long delay in setting
forth the matter, displaying a great confidence in himself,
an assurance in his own deductions and suppositions.</p>

<p>“Fog’s down again and the outer ice splitting up. If
the wind hauls around into the east’ard, we’ll be free soon
enough now. Blood and wounds! A month we’ve been
fighting this cursed ice. Now, Crawford, what’s to do
with ye? If the ice stops movin’ to-night, I’ll have that
bark of yours. Come over and hang Moses Deakin, eh?
Let ’em try it! If they come, you’re here for hostage; if
they come not, then ye lied to me and have a weak crew.”</p>

<p>Shrewd reasoning enough, and Crawford was keenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
alarmed by it. Deakin leaned forward, clawed his great
beard, grinned, and shot forth a direct question.</p>

<p>“So ye thought to sneak into the bay and steal the Star
Woman from me, eh?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“That’s a lie. Ha! Put steel into me, will ye? I say
again, that’s a lie! South sea passage, eh? Ye knew
well enough there was none. ’Twas the Star Woman ye
wanted. I know when a man tells the truth, Crawford.
It was a lie ye spoke about the south sea passage, and the
truth about the green star. So ye were on your way to her,
eh? There’s wizardry in that, or ye’d never ha’ found me
on the ice. Aye, wizardry! And as ye said, the star
brought ye here. It’s a warlock ye are, no doubt about
it.”</p>

<p>Crawford was somewhat bewildered by all this, but the
gaze of his captor settled and sobered him. Deakin sucked
at his pipe, while his abnormally large eyes fastened upon
his prisoner in a gaze that was oddly unwinking. Indeed,
from time to time the lids, instead of drooping, lifted
slightly and widened.</p>

<p>Once before had Crawford seen just such a stare as this,
but then in the eyes of a woman. That was years ago in
Ireland. He remembered the cold and rainy night, with
Phelim Burke sitting across the campfire, and the old
hag wandering in through the lines; the Wicklow Witch,
they called her. He remembered how she had squatted by
the fire, staring from him to Phelim Burke with that queer,
momentary distending of her eyes; and she had talked of
Granuaile and Red Hugh and Brian O’Rourke and others
of the mighty dead, as though she knew them well. With<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
an effort, Crawford forced himself back to the present
situation. He spoke quietly.</p>

<p>“Is this honest treatment of a guest, Moses Deakin?
I came freely with you——”</p>

<p>“Sink you and your fine words!” The Bostonnais
breathed deeply, his wide nostrils flaring, and removed the
pipe to scratch at his two-pronged tangle of grizzled beard.
He reverted at once to his own chosen subject.</p>

<p>“That French buccaneer, Frontin, gave ye news of her,
and the star brought ye here. Ay, that’ll be the way of it.
I’ll do ye no harm, Crawford, nor the star neither, for
I’ll need to walk carefully with warlocks, and can take no
chances. A Cree wizard told me two year ago that no
weapon or hand o’ man could kill me, and that I’d come
to my end only by the gift of a woman. So I ha’ naught
to do with women, unless it be the Star Woman. She
always smiles at me, so I know she be right friendly and
well-disposed.”</p>

<p>He paused, puffing his pipe into a last flicker of life.
Crawford gathered that in Deakin’s thought he was something
of a wizard, and was being treated to confidences.
This thought drew the ghost of a smile to his lips. He
racked his brains for some means of turning the fact to
his advantage, but found none. Deakin was obviously
wrapped up in his own fancies, which were sincere enough,
and now went on with his rambling talk.</p>

<p>“So last year I sent messages to the Star Woman by
the Injuns, bidding her come and meet me at my post this
summer. Far away she is, somewhere to the south and
west, but all the tribes know her name and fear it. Shall
we have a look at her, Crawford? Ay, say ye so. I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
have a smile from her sweet lips and tell ye what she’s
about this minute. Most like she’s over on the other shore
o’ the bay now, waiting for me. She’ll have had my message,
sent from tribe to tribe until it reached her.”</p>

<p>The giant laid aside his pipe. He shoved the heavy
table so that it came under the arms of Crawford’s chair
and under Crawford’s eye. Then, rising, he went to a
locker and produced a shallow pewter dish. He set this
on the table and reached down a flask, pouring into the
dish a dankly glittering fluid which might have been black
quicksilver, had there been such a thing. With the dish
between himself and Crawford, Deakin now tugged his
chair forward and reseated himself.</p>

<p>“First I’ll have a look at what’s in the straits,” he said.
“Put your eyes on the witch ink, Crawford, and tell me
what ye see.”</p>

<p>The Bostonnais stared down at the dark fluid, intent
and absorbed, his huge frame bent over, his pronged
beard sweeping the table, his immense hands outstretched
and motionless. The monstrous incongruity of such a
man engaged in so childish a task smote Crawford with
a mad impulse to burst out laughing; but he checked it
sternly enough. Whatever the man’s delusion might be,
it held a deadly sincerity. Also, Crawford had heard in
Boston that this Moses Deakin was famed for seeing
visions, and now he perceived the explanation of the rumours.</p>

<p>Crawford, being without any credulity and putting no
faith in witchcraft or second sight, waited for what might
come. It occurred to him that Deakin, if possessed of
any desire to apply his magic, might well summon up a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
vision of the <i>Northstar</i> at the moment, and save his scouts
the work. Those who work wizardry, however, apparently
eschew its more practical benefits.</p>

<p>“Look!” Deakin suddenly started, and his big hands
gripped. “Blood and wounds—a fifty-gun ship!”</p>

<p>Crawford gazed down at the dark fluid and saw in it
only the mirrored reflection of Deakin’s hairy visage.
The other man, however, spoke with growing excitement.</p>

<p>“White flag at her poop—a Frenchman! A ship o’ the
line, a royal ship! There’s men aboard her; ay, the faces
begin to come out now. What the Canadians doing aboard
she? And a red Injun, and fine officers in gold lace. I’ll
warrant the rogues are cold enough! And yonder’s her
cap’n; a fine handsome man he is, and a boy alongside
him, likely his brother——”</p>

<p>Crawford sent an astonished glance to the fluid, but saw
nothing. Could Deakin really be finding visions there?
That man and boy—they must be Iberville and Bienville!
He remembered now that Iberville had been awaiting ships
from France——</p>

<p>“It’s Iberville!” he exclaimed. “Iberville and his fleet!”</p>

<p>That name, so dreaded on the bay, smote the Bostonnais.
Lifting his head, Deakin showed in wild and hairy
countenance a sudden amazed awe. He thought Crawford,
too, had seen the vision.</p>

<p>“Warlock, wi’ the star at your breast—I knew it well
enough!” he breathed hoarsely. “Iberville, is it? Then
Moses Deakin goes not near the south o’ the bay this
voyage. Perdition take him and his Frenchmen! He be
no man, but devil incarnate. Nay, I’ll look no more at
him, but shall call up the Star Woman. Set a name to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
likewise, if ye can; sink me, Crawford, if ye have not
more power than I at my own game. Warlock, indeed!”</p>

<p>He lowered his face again and stared anew at the fluid.</p>

<p>Crawford, realizing now how the man was ridden by
superstition, tried vainly to discover some trick in the
matter, for he refused to believe that Deakin saw real
images. Perhaps the man knew that a French squadron
was heading north. Perhaps the whole thing was a lie
and a delusion, either deliberate trickery or self-deception
on Deakin’s part. Perhaps there were no ships in the
straits at all! That, indeed, was more likely than not.</p>

<p>“Now I see her!” cried out Deakin. “Look! She’s
standin’ at the door of a bark lodge—blood and wounds,
what a woman she is, too! White woman, too—gold hair
streaming all over her, with a star o’ blue stones on her
breast——”</p>

<p>Deakin was concentrated, tense, quivering with inward
excitation, completely gripped by his own fantasy. Crawford
could not but feel the infection. He peered down,
staring at the dish, yet seeing in it only the reflection of
those distended grey eyes. Through his brain raced the
words that Iberville had said to him, that evening above
Bay de Verde. A Spanish woman——</p>

<p>“Ay, she’s smiling at me! Put a name to her, ye warlock,
if ye can!”</p>

<p>“Her name’s Mariana,” said Crawford.</p>

<p>Deakin caught his breath gustily, lifted wild eyes at
Crawford, his wide nostrils flaring with each breath, his
beard twitching; to doubt the terrible earnestness of the
man was impossible.</p>

<p>Then came abrupt wakening, sudden and swift return<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
to sanity. From the deck overhead sounded a medley of
shouts and trampling feet, the rise of excited voices. Steps
thumped on the ladder, and into the cabin came the boatswain.
Deakin looked at him with a growled oath.</p>

<p>“The men are back, master,” said the man eagerly.
“There’s open water a half-mile outside of us—a wide
channel. The ice ha’ stopped moving outside and be
jammed once more to the north’ard. Fog down like always,
but the upper wind’s hauling around. Looks like
she’ll be in east’ard before a great while, master.”</p>

<p>Deakin stared at him a moment, then crashed out rapid
orders.</p>

<p>“That means the ice be goin’ fast. Get out the skids
and chock the pinnace into ’em for haulin’ across the ice.
Lay food and powder in her, and muskets. Lay the little
skiff overside likewise—we’ll carry her across to open
water.”</p>

<p>“Be goin’ to leave the ship?” came the astonished query.</p>

<p>“Ay, bose. We be going to take Crawford’s ship—gold
aboard her! We’ll work up to her i’ the pinnace,
take her, and be back afore morning. Leave the three
men worst down wi’ scurvy to hold the <i>Albemarle</i> and signal
us. Ice won’t go out afore turn o’ the tide come morning.
Sharp, now, sharp does it! We ha’ no time to dilly
away. Chuck me down a coil o’ light line as ye go.”</p>

<p>Bose disappeared. Moses Deakin returned the dark
fluid to its flask, placed it with the dish in the locker, then
turned and stared at Crawford.</p>

<p>“Two hundred pound for ye in Boston town!” His
barrel of a chest heaved in a deep breath of resignation.
“No, I’ll take no chances. Two hundred pound is much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
gold, but a warlock is not to be tampered with. I’ll do ye
no hurt, nor the star neither. None the less, I’ll not leave
ye free to shout.”</p>

<p>A coil of line rattled down the ladder. Deakin picked
it up, tore a piece of canvas from a dirty tarpaulin in one
corner, and came to Crawford. The latter was firmly and
efficiently gagged before he realized what was happening.</p>

<p>Deakin had thoroughly convinced himself that Crawford
was something in the nature of a wizard, and that
the emerald jewel was a thing of magic power. Only
this obsession explained his reluctant decision to let the
jewel go, not to mention the very valuable head of its
bearer. That he should thus pass up two hundred pounds
was an eloquent testimony to his sincerity. Crawford
stirred uneasily in his bonds, wondering what was now
about to take place.</p>

<p>“Our friend may have man’s reason in the carcase of an
animal,” he reflected, “but so much the worse for him. If
he had the brain of an animal, he’d be better off. If he
doesn’t mean to hurt me, what the devil does he mean?
And why this gag?”</p>

<p>As though in response to this silent query, Deakin called
down two of his men. They freed Crawford from the
chair, then lashed his wrists together in front of him, and
to the lashing attached a length of line. His feet were
left free.</p>

<p>“All ready above?” inquired the Bostonnais.</p>

<p>“Ay, master.”</p>

<p>“Then come ye with me, Crawford.” Deakin took the
length of line and went to the ladder, the captive perforce
following him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>So they came out on deck, and Crawford was helped to
climb over the side to the ice. There the crew were
grouped about the longboat or pinnace, which was choked
upon runners with ropes attached for pulling, and a tiny
skiff which six of them picked up bodily. Three scurvy-staggering
rascals bawled thin farewells from the rail
above.</p>

<p>“Compass in pinnace, bose?” asked Deakin. “Then
come along to open water.”</p>

<p>He marched in the lead, a huge, ungainly figure, with
Crawford on the line behind him. The men followed,
carrying the skiff and dragging the pinnace on its sled.
Thick fog was settled down about the <i>Albemarle</i>, and in
ten paces she was lost to sight behind them. Under that
fog, all was dark; the slanting sunlight of the arctic summer’s
night was lost for a little while, ice and melted pools
held obscure terror instead of fiery rainbow-hued splendour.
Moses Deakin lifted his head, sniffed with his wide
nostrils, and like an animal led straight for the open water
which he could smell.</p>

<p>In this fashion half a mile was covered, the last of it
being very precarious, since the floes were split into great
cakes, while sharp cracks and reports told how further
splitting was in progress. Then, abruptly, Deakin halted
at the very edge of open water, swirling dark and ice-dotted
as far as eye could pierce.</p>

<p>“Wind on the shift and ice be goin’ out to-morrow,”
he announced, though Crawford could detect no faintest
breath of breeze. “Launch the craft, now. Current
settin’ out—good! Into the skiff, Crawford.”</p>

<p>Still far from realizing what was intended, Crawford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
climbed into the skiff while the men held it to the verge
of the floe. Deakin leaned over the little craft, which
was empty of oars or anything else, and lashed the captive’s
lead-line about a thwart. Then he unsheathed his
knife and tossed it into the bottom of the skiff, took the
craft by her stern, and with one mighty heave sent her
swirling out into the foggy water.</p>

<p>“By the time ye get yourself free, ye’ll be safe enough!”
came his roaring bellow. “And you’re warlock enough
to reach the shore. Fare ye well, Crawford! Now, lads,
get matches lighted and into the pinnace with ye all!
We’re off for Crawford’s bark——”</p>

<p>The fog closed in. Its chill was no worse than the chill
in Crawford’s heart as the swift currents bore his little
skiff out into the bay.</p>

<p>Swept away into darkness almost immediately, he devoted
all his energies to getting rid of the lashing about
his arms. First he had to reach the knife, which was no
simple task in itself; then, doubling over, gripping it between
his feet, he must hack and saw at the line which
bound him. The motion of the boat added to the difficulty,
since the skiff was rocking against cakes of ice or
rolling in sudden surges sent out from the welter of smashing
floes and pans. The vast field of ice was now breaking
up for good. The whole night was filled with a mighty
diapason of the roaring masses, pierced by shriller notes
of splitting floes and the occasional booming of an overturned
berg.</p>

<p>During all this straining time, Crawford’s mind did not
dwell particularly upon his own fate, which seemed inevitable
enough. By the gradual appearance of freer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
water around, he knew that the currents were rapidly
bearing him offshore, out into the vast inland sea, helpless
to steer his craft or to hinder his destiny. Yet in this
while, his thoughts reverted to two things—first to the
Star Woman, second to that blood-stained paper which he
had pressed into Frontin’s hand on parting with his lieutenant.</p>

<p>He felt all amazed by Deakin’s words regarding the Star
Woman. The man had been indubitably sincere in believing
that such a person existed; as he had said, Deakin
must have heard of her through the Bay Indians. Iberville
had heard of her, also. The very name, taken in conjunction
with the emblem which lay on Crawford’s breast,
would have been impressive to a superstitious man; Crawford,
however, was not superstitious. He was not impressed
in the least by Deakin’s ravings, but he was tremendously
perplexed by this new recurrence of the Star
Woman in his own destiny.</p>

<p>“Why not find her, then—why not?” he muttered.
“Still, I have more pressing affairs in hand at the present
moment, if I am to find anything except a watery grave.
Will Frontin understand that paper, I wonder?”</p>

<p>The paper in question had been taken from the body
of Moses Deakin’s lieutenant. Crawford, in his hasty
glance, had caught only the first line of writing, yet it now
came back into his mind with redoubled emphasis. The
words were simple: “Acct. of Goods to Bee broke out for
ye trade att ye Daniche River.” Wherever this Danish
river might lie—the name was totally unknown to Crawford—there
also must be Deakin’s secret trading rendezvous
with the redskins. What a chance!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>“Ah, free!” he exclaimed, when at last his arms were at
liberty and he could chafe his numbed and swollen hands
into life. “Now, if I had but a sail and a chart of this
bay, I’d still best that hairy devil. Warlock, am I? Ha—a
breeze! To work, warlock!”</p>

<p>A faint breath of wind fanned his cheek. There was
no lift to the fog, which rolled down more thick and dark
than ever, nor was the little breeze likely to rift it. Crawford,
facing the situation, found himself in total ignorance
of direction. If the breeze came from the east, as
Deakin had said, he would be carried off the land. He had
no food or water, no blankets or sail; he had only the
clothes on his back, the naked knife, and the light line
which had captived him.</p>

<p>With these things, he went to work.</p>

<p>Despite the bitter chill of the fog, he was forced to dispense
with his outer fur-lined coat. Then he smashed the
’midships thwart of the boat and split the long plank
lengthwise until he had sticks to serve his purpose. These
he fitted and spliced together with unravelled hemp, until
he had a stout six-foot mast. Another stick in the arms
of the coat made a very fair dipping-lug rig. To get this
rig installed was another matter. Eventually, however,
he had the mast stayed in place, got up his makeshift sail,
made fast the lines, and chuckled softly as he felt the
faint breeze take hold. He lay across the thwarts and
heard the water go rippling more swiftly past the counter.</p>

<p>“Warlock indeed!” he commented, with a laugh. “The
Star of Dreams is still guiding, and whither the star goes,
I follow. It may well be that there is some truth behind
all this rank superstition—singular, how Deakin spoke of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
the Star Woman! Coincidence in the names, of course—yet
I wonder!”</p>

<p>He laughed again at the fancy, but quickly sobered.
Crawford himself was tempted to be a trifle superstitious
about that emerald star. First he had taken it as a symbol
of his own flight from the world, of his quest after a
freedom that did not exist. From talking of it with Frontin
or Sir Phelim Burke, a reaction had inevitably taken
effect upon his own mind. He fought against this and
scorned it, yet none the less it lingered. Consequently,
Deakin’s belief in a connection between star and Star
Woman made an appeal to him—until he forced himself
to dismiss the whole thing as the wanderings of an unsound
brain, the superstitious fancy of a bestial man.</p>

<p>“The Danish river!” he reflected, coming back again
to his immediate problems. “If I knew where that place
lay, and had food, I believe I’d try for it——”</p>

<p>He was now out of the ice and distinctly warmer, the
breeze was freshening slightly, the fog was somewhat less
dense. So, careless whither he was carried, he found the
boat’s bottom to be sound and dry, and promptly curled
up for a much-needed sleep.</p>

<p>Morning came and he slept on, while the long wraiths
of grey fog fled across the waters and thinned into shadows,
and the wind came ever fresher and steadier out of
the southeast to scatter the dissipating mist and blow the
skiff out to north and west. Behind her the morning
broadened, and overhead the fog gave place to blue sky,
although the sun itself remained dun and dim behind the
heavy wrack of grey obscurity that still overhung the
straits and the Labrador coast. Ahead in the west, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
the fog went whirling away and was gone, until presently
the sunlight struck all the wide expanse of sea into
glittering radiance, with the enormous granite cliffs of
Mansfield island forming a long blur against the western
horizon. Off to the east and north the ice blink made
shimmering response to the sunlight, and from the straits
came the thunderous rumble and grind of ice-masses fighting
for freedom beneath the fog-blanket.</p>

<p>Crawford wakened. He sat up, blinking at the sunlight,
then stared at the running white crests all around, and
laughed in sudden joyous remembrance.</p>

<p>“I’ll whip you yet, Moses Deakin!” he cried out exultantly.
“No food, no rudder, no sail, no compass—yet
I’ll whip you, sink me if I don’t! Ay, warlock or not, I
may give you a fight—for the—Star——”</p>

<p>The words died on his lips as he swung about and swept
his eager gaze along the horizon. For there, not a mile
to the northeast and standing squarely for him out of the
cloud-bank that still hovered low above the straits, was
a fifty-gun ship—white canvas towering up into the sky
as she leaned over and headed for him across the wind!
Crawford stared at her all agape, incredulous, then leaped
to his feet with a blaze of excitement in his blue eyes.
The French ship! Iberville! As he stood, thus, leaning
to the thrust of the boat and staring, the emerald jewel
came out from beneath his shirt; he replaced it with fumbling
fingers, and a laugh broke on his lips.</p>

<p>“The Star of Dreams, eh? There lies the ship Deakin
saw in his vision, and it seems that I’m destined to meet
Iberville again. Did Deakin see the Star Woman also?”</p>

<p>He had no answer to this query, but meet Iberville he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
did, half an hour later, when he clambered up the side of
the <i>Pelican</i> frigate and struck hands with the eldest of
the famous Le Moyne brethren. Young Bienville, boy in
years yet wearing man’s uniform, stood beside Iberville,
and greeted Crawford with a cry and a hearty embrace.</p>

<p>“I knew it was you! Pierre scoffed at me, but I knew
it!”</p>

<p>Crawford laughed into the ardent eyes of the handsome
youngster, then turned to the strong and masterful
brother, who welcomed him with equal warmth.</p>

<p>“My faith, it’s incredible!” said Iberville. “Why are
you here alone in an open boat, M. Crawford? Where’s
that bark you had from me?”</p>

<p>“Lay the tale on the shoulders of food, drink and tobacco,
and it’ll go better,” replied Crawford. Instantly
Iberville took his arm and led him aft, with hasty apologies,
while the ship’s yards were squared and she fell off
on her course. Crawford’s gaze took in the staring Rochefort
marines, the clustered seamen, the groups of Canadians;
then he was being introduced to the officers—Grandville
of the marines, and La Salle, the wild bush-loper
Martigny, who had raided Acadia and Newfoundland
with Iberville, the royal commissioner La Potherie,
and others.</p>

<p>Now, knowing his man, Iberville led Crawford down
to the cabin and shut out all save Bienville. Then, with
food and wine before him, Crawford began to relate what
had happened since his meeting and parting with the Le
Moynes in Newfoundland. In the midst, there came a
wild hammering at the door. In burst a red-haired, cassocked
figure who greeted Crawford with a huge yell of
joy and gripped his shoulders affectionately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>“Hal Crawford—by the piper! I was below with a
poor dyin’ devil and——”</p>

<p>“Fitzmaurice of Kerry!” exclaimed Crawford. “Why,
this is a dream——”</p>

<p>“Lad, lad, it’s like old times to see ye!” burst out Fitzmaurice,
chaplain of the fleet. “Dost remember Limerick
town, and the hammerer in the breach, and Phelim Burke
na Murtha, and how Dutch William’s men poured in on
us——”</p>

<p>“Phelim’s here on the bay!” cried Crawford. Then
Iberville laughed, slammed the door shut again, and intervened.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Fitzmaurice, or I’ll send you back to shrive
more scurvy-sick men! Let the man talk. Crawford,
give me the news I crave! Have you met English ships in
the straits? Have you seen any but this Bostonnais you
were mentioning?”</p>

<p>“None,” rejoined Crawford. “Where’s the rest of your
fleet?”</p>

<p>Iberville shrugged. “How do I know? Ahead of us,
we believe. We’ve been fighting the ice for weeks. The
last I saw of the others was two days ago. My brother
Serigny was far ahead of us in the <i>Palmier</i>. The <i>Profound</i>,
under Du Guai, was almost at open water, and the
<i>Wasp</i> likewise. We left the <i>Violent</i> at Placentia for repairs.
We had news that an English fleet was on the way,
but have seen nothing of them.”</p>

<p>The excited Irish chaplain settled down, Crawford swallowed
his wine and lighted a pipe, and all four men fell
into talk. Iberville, avid for news, was confident that his
brother Serigny and the other three ships were already
steering across the bay for Fort Nelson, at which post he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
meant to strike the first blow. When he had heard Crawford’s
tale, he nodded.</p>

<p>“Strange words! Did this Bostonnais really see anything
in the dish? My faith, I’d like to know! So you’ve
given up the south sea passage, Crawford? Art going to
find the Star Woman?”</p>

<p>Crawford shook his head. “I know not, Iberville—my
first hope shall be to find my friends and ship again.
Time enough for that.”</p>

<p>“Ay, we’ll have news of them, never fear!” Iberville
rose. “Rest assured, you shall have your ship again and
the best charts we can give you. M. l’Abbé, I offered this
roving rascal a commission if he would sail with me—and
he refused. Yet behold, here he is! Is this the hand
of providence or not?”</p>

<p>“I’d call it Hal Crawford’s luck!” said Fitzmaurice,
with a chuckle. “But where to, Pierre? Sit down, man,
and smoke a pipe——”</p>

<p>“I must lay out the course and watch the charts,” said
Iberville. “These pilots are afraid of the ice and shallows.
Have out your talk in peace.”</p>

<p>He departed. Bienville, leaning across the table with
his eyes ashine, listened eagerly while Crawford and
the chaplain conned the days that had elapsed since Limerick
and Boynewater. Once Crawford turned to him
gaily.</p>

<p>“And suppose we find the English fleet ahead of us,
Bienville?”</p>

<p>The boy shrugged. “Ask Pierre! We’ve put some of
our guns and thirty seamen aboard the <i>Profound</i>, and
twoscore of our men are down below with scurvy. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
we’ll not find the enemy ahead of us. Pierre is always
the first, never fear!”</p>

<p>So the <i>Pelican</i> drove on to her destiny, while men
laughed and made merry aboard her at thought of the
green land so near, nor dreamed to what doom they rushed
so merrily. And, while she drove on, strange things were
taking place behind her at the mouth of the straits, where
the curtains of fog still lingered and blew away and returned
again.</p>

<p>Strange things, indeed, and stranger sounds echoing back
from these ironbound cliffs than any they had yet heard
since man came to these seas. For there the flash of cannon
split the fog, and the crashing thunder of broadsides
boomed back from the headlands. When the thick mist
lifted for a space that morning, the <i>Profound</i> was fast
nipped in the ice, with three unsuspected English frigates
about her stern; whereupon, as the terse chronicler puts
it, “Du Guai attacked.” Hour after hour he fought the
three with his two little stern-guns, hour after hour they
poured their shot into him, until the fog closed down again
and they deemed him sunk, and the roaring cliffs fell silent.</p>

<p>There, too, before this fight happened, Moses Deakin
had fallen upon fate and found it bitter to the taste. Before
the dawn came, he sighted the flare of a ship in the
ice, and drove his men at her. He thought her Crawford’s
bark, but she was something else—the <i>Hudson’s Bay</i>,
crowded with extra seamen and servants of the English
company, and in command of her was grim old Nick
Smithsend, who hanged fur-pirates and Frenchmen alike.
The end of this matter was that Moses Deakin and half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
his Boston men sat in irons to await hanging at Nelson,
and the other half of them lay dead upon the ice.</p>

<p>And there, too, but farther south under the cliffs, Frontin
and Sir Phelim Burke and their men fell upon the corvette
<i>Albemarle</i> in the dawning. None too soon either,
for the floes and shore ice were breaking up beneath their
feet. Deakin’s three scurvy-smitten men fought them and
were cut down. One of these, before he died, related the
fate that had befallen Crawford. Then fell Frontin to
work like a madman, and all of them likewise. Presently
the <i>Albemarle</i> was working out through ice-channels, until
she gained open water with the early light of day and
tacked back and forth through the mist while the guns
roared to the northward. No sign of Crawford’s little
skiff did they find, however.</p>

<p>So they, who no less than Moses Deakin had their destiny
to accomplish, tacked down to the southward that
day and then back again, seeking vainly. And at set of
sun, when the fog lifted for a little space, there suddenly
loomed through the greyness a huge shape, and a gun
thundered in air above them, and over the puny, frightened
corvette frowned the heavy batteries of Serigny in the
<i>Palmier</i>. The Frenchmen came aboard and took her.
Frontin, cursing bitterly, shook his fist at the fog and
blasphemed like the buccaneer he was, as the ship was
headed to the west and south. Then came storm that
night, and the pilots were ignorant of the bay, and the
ships drove blindly before the wind.</p>

<p>Thus did fate, working through the activities of little
men, lay out a blood-red net in which to snare heroes.
And Iberville, all unwitting, bore up for Fort Nelson.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

CONFIRMING A BELIEF IN MIRACLES</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> this early night of September there was gaiety
aboard the <i>Pelican</i>. She lay anchored ten miles
southwest of Fort Nelson, in the open bay. Upon
reaching the river the previous day, she found all buoys
destroyed and the channel-marks removed, so that Iberville
dared not attempt the precarious river entrance,
across the wide mud flats, until he had taken soundings.
The bay charts and pilots were all with Serigny, as were
the supplies and siege guns, and he was bitterly disappointed
not to find his other three ships here ahead of
him. At least he had beaten the English squadron, however.</p>

<p>So Martigny and a score of Canadians departed in the
pinnace to take soundings, scout the fort, and roam the
woods in search of friendly Indians, and that evening high
celebration was held aboard ship. The guns were shifted,
battle lanterns hung about, all hands made merry. There
were fiddles, with a flute or two to help, and no lack of
good wine all around. French and Canadians sang chansons
and Mohawk chants and gay sentimental court ballads,
officers and men intermingling in Latin good-fellowship,
voyageur and chevalier dancing and drinking together,
Iberville joining hands with his powder boys.</p>

<p>Crawford, who took small part in all this gaiety, tired
of looking on and presently went up into the bows. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
stood there smoking, his eyes watching the play of lights
in the northern sky that fought the dim, sunny twilight in
the south. There Iberville found him presently, when he
strolled up with La Potherie, and clapped him heartily on
the shoulder.</p>

<p>“What, dreaming of stars? Come and try our excellent
Canary. To-morrow Martigny will return with the pinnace,
we’ll land guns and men, and crack this nut of Nelson.
Ha! Art thinking of the Star Woman, eh?”</p>

<p>“Admitted. The name lingers. Do you know more of
her than Perrot told?”</p>

<p>“Nay, Perrot is the only white man who has ever seen
her.”</p>

<p>Here Bacqueville de la Potherie struck in with avid interest.
He was the avowed historian of the expedition,
and was eager to learn of all things, while his open curiosity,
his frankness and intelligence, endeared him to
every one alike.</p>

<p>“Tell me about this Perrot—I have heard of him before
this. And the Star Woman——”</p>

<p>Iberville obliged, and concluded with a laugh, “So, you
see, our friend Crawford may yet set forth into the wilderness
to seek her! Eh, Crawford? Why so gloomy,
man?”</p>

<p>“Why so merry?” Crawford smiled. “It may be that
I shall seek her. Who knows? I’m not gloomy, but your
gay scene is not for me. I’m looking over the horizon.”</p>

<p>“You’ll die of that looking, one day.”</p>

<p>“Ay. And how better?”</p>

<p>Iberville nodded soberly, his spirit perfectly comprehending
that of Crawford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>“How better, indeed? There’s blood of mine in those
dark forests ashore. My brother Chateauguay lies under
the pickets of that fort, which I have taken once or twice
ere this, and shall take again. Well, I fight for my king
while you fight for a dream—and devil shrive me if I’d
not like to seek the Star Woman with you! Don’t look
too long at those lights in the sky—ah, but you should
see them in winter, as I have seen them from yonder
shores! Some say they foretell storm in summer. The
Indians call them the spirits of dancing dead men. Faith,
there’ll be dead men dancing ashore once I get a mortar
to bear on that accursed fort behind its cloak of
trees! Come, Bacqueville, leave our man of destiny to
dream——”</p>

<p>The other two departed, and Crawford presently went
to the cabin which he shared with Fitzmaurice of Kerry.
In ten minutes he was sound asleep to the whine of fiddles
and the soft throatings of flutes.</p>

<p>It was broad daylight when he wakened to a great tumult
of trampling feet on the decks, mingled with roars
of joyous shouts and exultant oaths. The chaplain burst
in upon him and in furious delight dragged him bodily
from his berth.</p>

<p>“Up and on deck, ye sluggard! Here the fleet’s in
sight—Serigny’s come at last, and we’re standing out to
meet ’em! Up, ye lazy divil!”</p>

<p>Crawford flung on his clothes hastily enough. When
he got on deck, he found the <i>Pelican</i> heading out for the
open bay, where three distant sail were leaning down
the wind. The air had turned bitter cold overnight and
storm was brewing in the grey sky, but who cared for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
that? Serigny was sighted, the long voyage was ended in
triumph, a stroke at Nelson would be made ere set of
sun! Out stood the ship to welcome her comrades, gay
flags decking her spars, and Grandville’s gunners unstopping
cannon for a salute of welcoming.</p>

<p>Gaining the high poop-deck by the helm, where Iberville
stood with his brother, Crawford joined the group
of officers there. Signals were run up, and Iberville
raised a glass to scrutinize the approaching ships. Then
Crawford saw his eyes widen, saw him lower the glass,
saw a sudden deadly pallor creeping into his cheeks. For
one instant Iberville stood thus as though paralyzed, then
turned and quietly touched the arm of La Potherie.</p>

<p>“Bacqueville, order food served out at once—swiftly!
Then take charge of the forecastle; I’ll send the Canadians
to you. Bienville, how many men aboard fit for
service?”</p>

<p>“A hundred and twoscore, Pierre,” returned the boy
carelessly. “Forty sick below, a score gone with Martigny
in the pinnace—”</p>

<p>“Go below. Tell Grandville and La Salle to clear the
lower deck for action. You’ll take the upper tier with
De Ligondez. Why the devil didn’t Martigny come back
last night—we’ve not men enough to man the guns! Here,
sergeant!” A Rochefort marine saluted. “Have hand-ropes
stretched along the decks—ice is forming already,
I see. Order the magazines opened. St. Martin! Get
every Canadian to the forecastle instantly, under La
Potherie, with fusils and fresh horns of powder, and serve
out bullets. Swiftly, swiftly! Roundshot on deck,
there!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>At these rapid and impetuous orders, every eye was fastened
on Iberville in stupefied amazement. From the
masthead now rang down a sharp cry.</p>

<p>“No signals answered!”</p>

<p>Silence came upon the ship, a dread and terrible silence
of horrified incredulity, of dismayed consternation—until
a Canadian gave voice to the sharp, yelping war whoop of
the Mohawks. Then all beheld tiny flecks of scarlet break
out from the three ships bearing down the wind, and the
white smoke of a gun jetted from the foremast.</p>

<p>Not Serigny—but the enemy!</p>

<p>“You’ll run out to sea?” Crawford turned to Iberville.
The latter smiled grimly, his eyes flitting over the ship,
not answering for a moment.</p>

<p>Here mad activity was leaping forth—gunners stripping,
boys on the run with powder and shot, ports slamming
open, ropes being stretched for hand-hold, guns
being unstopped. Spray was forming into ice as it fell.
Iberville turned and silently swept his arm in three directions.
This threefold gesture included the shore to
the north, the long stretches of shallows and reefs to west
and south—and to the eastward the open sea where the
three English ships foamed down the wind.</p>

<p>“Why run, when one must fight?” said Iberville briefly.
“Stand by the helm, my friend, for I’ll have need of your
quick eye and hand there! The <i>Pelican</i> goes forward.”</p>

<p>Go forward she did, with the crash of a gun to echo the
words.</p>

<p>It meant something that Iberville was a captain in the
royal navy, in a day when ensigns commanded brigs,
lieutenants sailed frigates, and captains manœuvred fleets.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
Against him were three ships, each of them alone a fair
match for the crippled <i>Pelican</i>, and four veteran commanders
of the English company who knew every foot of
the uncharted waters.</p>

<p>During three and a half hours Iberville fought them
with his seamanship, while his lieutenants fought them
with small arms and great, and the guns thundered. The
tactics of the English never varied. They had Iberville
where they wanted him—far outnumbered, cut off from
flight, with treacherous shoals reaching from the land for
miles to entrap him. Again and again they tried to force
him in upon the shallows; again and again he evaded the
trap, tacking back and forth, taking their hurricane of
shot as he slipped past, while his own guns roared unceasingly.
Ball and grape screamed through his rigging,
for their great intent was to dismast and cripple and
pound him into submission. As fast as a line was shot
away, the seamen were up and repairing it, and ever Iberville
kept just out of their reach, kept off the shoals, kept
giving back broadside for broadside.</p>

<p>The wind was freshening fast, the cold was growing
more intense, threat of snow was in the air. On the forecastle
clustered the dark Canadians, half-naked and
painted to the waist, joining musketry and Mohawk
whoop to the din; La Salle and Grandville fought the
lower-deck guns, young Bienville the upper tier after
Chevalier de Ligondez was struck down. From every
hand iron and lead were smashing into the devoted <i>Pelican</i>,
until her decks were red with frozen blood as she
tacked and wore, and the handlines were crimson-dripping
streaks; yet ever she evaded the shoals. Fitzmaurice of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
Kerry tended a gun or knelt beside a dying man indifferently,
and from the tall figure of Iberville shot swift and
cool orders to Crawford, who helped swing the great rudder
of the doomed ship. Doomed she was, as every man
there knew ere the fight was an hour gone, yet in the furious
exultancy of battle none cared.</p>

<p>Solid shot and grape and musketry they poured into
her, and she gave back shot and grape and ball—but each
time a little less swiftly, as her gunners died, and scurvy-smitten
scarecrows staggered up from below to drag
weakly at the guns. Foot by foot, it seemed, she was
driven back, cornered and hemmed in, the three ships
bearing around her like wolves around a stag at bay.
Noon came and passed, but none thought of food. Crawford,
following the anxious looks of Iberville, saw the
storm-clouds sweeping blackly down, knew the wind was
thickening, swung the helm grimly. Then, suddenly,
from Iberville burst one shrill and frightful yell.</p>

<p>“Wear, Crawford, wear—for the love of the saints,
wear——”</p>

<p>Crawford flung himself to help the St. Malo man at the
helm. There upon them was bearing the <i>Hampshire</i>, driving
full down the wind with obvious intent to ram and
sink the battered <i>Pelican</i>. A huge ship was the <i>Hampshire</i>,
a royal navy ship new and stoutly built, and
Fletcher was on her quarterdeck. He had Iberville to
reckon with, however, and he failed in his stroke, and
Crawford saw him shaking his fist and cursing in furious
rage as he lost the weather-gauge and was evaded.</p>

<p>With this, the two ships ran down the wind yard to yard,
so close that boarders gathered in readiness, so close that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
bulwarks almost touched at every sea, so close that English
and French answered curse with curse, grenade with
grenade—while the great guns thundered in broadsides
that left each ship rocking and reeling and staggering down
the rolling seas. Fletcher would not be first to draw off,
nor would Iberville; so the guns roared, and men died,
until a last crashing broadside sent the <i>Pelican</i> up into the
wind with half her rigging cut away and more than half
the men in her waist mowed down by a storm of grape.
In this moment she was theirs for the taking.</p>

<p>But there was none to take her.</p>

<p>Crawford, struck down by a splinter, was dragged to
his feet by the shrill, terrible scream of dying men. He
looked for the enemy ship, and saw only a welter of shattered
masts and rigging; like a sounding whale she had
plunged bodily, was gone all in an instant, down until she
staggered upon the shallows and lay quiet with only her
topmasts above water, and wounded men shrieking as they
drowned.</p>

<p>“Hard over!” shouted Iberville, and leaped to the helm.
“At them, Bienville—fire!”</p>

<p>Once more the guns crashed out, and now for the last
time. As Iberville swooped upon her, the <i>Hudson’s Bay</i>
reeled up into the wind and lowered flag and foresail.
The <i>Dering</i>, not waiting to face the Frenchman alone,
shook out her reefed sails and went scudding away
through the whistling tempest for Fort Nelson and safety.</p>

<p>Iberville groaned as his gaze swept the red-frozen deck,
while his ship bore down upon Nick Smithsend’s crippled
frigate. Then he was at the helm, once more in action.</p>

<p>“Take fifteen Malouins and board her as we touch,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
Crawford! Swiftly! I must away to catch the <i>Dering</i>—swiftly,
swiftly! Get her into the river if ye can——”</p>

<p>Crawford leaped into the bloody waist, while Iberville’s
voice sent some St. Malo seamen to join him. The two
ships came staggering and reeling together, and grapnels
were flung out. Crawford jumped across the shattered
rails, the men trailing after. Somehow all scrambled
aboard, the irons were flung off, and the shattered <i>Pelican</i>
went lurching away in pursuit of Grimmington and the
fleeing <i>Dering</i>.</p>

<p>Here on the prize Crawford stood aghast. The ship
was torn to ribbons alow and aloft. He found dying
men, blood freezing in pools, screams and curses of
wounded resounding. Smithsend came up to him, bitterly
enough, and started at Crawford’s English words.</p>

<p>“Your parole, cap’n? Good. I’m to take you into the
river if possible.”</p>

<p>“More like into hell,” growled Smithsend. “Rudder’s
gone, we’re half full of water, not men enough alive to
man a tier of guns——”</p>

<p>As something touched his face, Crawford looked up and
saw a drift of white snowflakes breaking down the wind
like a silver cloud.</p>

<p>“Run in beside the wreck of your frigate and anchor,
and get the pumps to working,” he said, and ordered his
men to help the English seamen.</p>

<p>Groping her way, the wounded ship slowly reeled in
toward the shallows and dropped anchor, still miles off
the land. There was no help to be given the crew of the
<i>Hampshire</i>; these had vanished under the icy water, to
the last man. Crawford met with no opposition as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
took over the ship, for the English were dazed, stunned,
unable to realize how they had been beaten and broken by
a single ship. Gradually they recovered, fell to work
wearily enough, taking up the new fight to save their ship
and their lives.</p>

<p>While some patched up the gaping holes below and
got the ports closed again, others labored getting the
pumps into action. Crawford, seeking for wounded,
crawled into the forepeak with a man to hold a lantern.
And, as the light was held up, he gazed into the snarling
features of Moses Deakin. Astounded, he saw that
Deakin was not only in irons, but was half buried under
the shot-torn bodies of other men in irons, while a horrible
sound of groaning came out of the darkness around.
Crawford’s face showing in the lantern-light, a great cry
burst from Deakin.</p>

<p>“Crawford! Blood and wounds—be it you or not?”</p>

<p>Crawford made no response. Leaving his men to care
for the wounded, he turned and went back on deck. He
sought out Smithsend and discovered to his amazement
how Deakin had come to be aboard; for the present, however,
he let things bide as they were in the face of more
important matters, hoping that the situation would become
no worse for all of them.</p>

<p>Vain hope! Hours later, the shot-riven <i>Pelican</i>, having
failed to catch the <i>Dering</i>, came tacking back in the driving
snowstorm and anchored alongside the prize. Iberville
demanded pilotage into the river, but stout Smithsend,
who had flung his charts and directions overboard,
refused point-blank. Iberville now managed to sling a
mortar aboard the prize, with a few marines, bidding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
Crawford get into the river if he could; for by this time
there was no doubt whatever as to the issue. It was <i>sauve
qui peut</i>!</p>

<p>The storm had settled into a howling tempest out of the
northeast, which precluded any hope of beating off the
land, and with night the sea was rising in huge billows
sweeping down the full length of the bay. Hawser after
hawser parted. In vain Crawford and Smithsend tried to
keep the rudderless ship where she was. From the
wounded men came low shrieks of utter despair as the
frigate went staggering blindly down the wind, ice forming
over everything, snow hiding the foamy seas from
sight, nothing to be seen in the gloom but the faces of
unburied dead men peering horribly through shrouds of
ice.</p>

<p>In vain did they try to steer with booms or oars. It
was a night of horror, with naught to be done save to work
the pumps and hope for the best, as the weight of ice
dragged her more heavily down by the nose and she drifted
aimlessly and without direction. A little after midnight,
Crawford crawled down to where Moses Deakin lay, and
after unlocking the man’s irons gave him the keys.</p>

<p>“If any of your men be alive, set them loose. I can’t
leave you here to drown like rats. Come up above, get
some food, and lend a hand with the pumps.”</p>

<p>Then Crawford was back on deck again, where Smithsend
was trying to fashion a jury rudder from the smashed
spars aloft.</p>

<p>Toward morning the ship struck heavily, but wrenched
free, passed over the shoal, and drove on. With daylight
the storm was whirling down worse than ever, huge waves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
bursting over the whole ship, water gaining on the pumps,
every man reeling with weariness and utter exhaustion.
During a lull in the tempest, Crawford peered off to starboard
and saw a dim shape rolling sternfirst before the
wind, and knew that the <i>Pelican</i> was plunging to her
doom. The brazen voice of Moses Deakin thundered at
his ear.</p>

<p>“She’s driving on the middle shoal—she’ll strike, and
the land six mile away! We’re well outside. Pray to
your star now, Crawford! We’ll go ashore twenty mile
farther down the coast.”</p>

<p>Both ships were indeed lost, since the shores were miles
distant and guarded by long shallows, all the small boats
were shot away, and with every moment the weight of
new ice was bearing the bows deeper into the water. So
they drove on, and any thought of enmity betwixt French
and English was forgotten, death being close upon all
alike. Fur-pirates and company servants and French marines
huddled together or worked at the pumps in dismal
despair.</p>

<p>With afternoon came more snow, hiding all the shores
ahead. Crawford was at work in the icy bows, trying to
chop loose a spare anchor, when suddenly he and his men
were sent all asprawl on the ice, grasping at the handlines,
hurled headlong. With a hideous lurch and shudder,
the doomed ship struck, lifted, and struck again.</p>

<p>Crawford saw the masts topple, heard the crash of
splintered wood above the roar of the storm, and then was
swept overboard with the tangle of masts and spars and
rigging. And this, for the moment, was the end of everything
so far as Crawford was concerned. After a little he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
revived, gasping, and managed to lash himself to the litter
of wreckage, but passed again into oblivion.</p>

<p>If Crawford was gone, however, Moses Deakin remained;
and if ever a man made use of his head with
certain death on all sides, that man was the Bostonnais.
He had survived a perilous trade these many years by
just such ability. He knew well that no mercy awaited
him either from French or English—and Deakin acted
accordingly. Receiving no mercy, he was not the man to
accord mercy.</p>

<p>The ship was sogged into the shallows with her bows
under water, waist and high stern exposed and beginning
to break up fast as the thunderous rollers burst above her.
All was confusion, flying spray, screams of the wounded
as they washed away. On the poop, Smithsend was
knocking together a raft to float some of the hurt men
ashore. The land was at least three miles distant, but was
quite hidden behind snow and obscurity. So far as Deakin
was concerned, the land was as perilous as the bay,
but he had no choice and so acted swiftly.</p>

<p>His brazen voice gathered three of his surviving men,
and with these he made his way to the waist of the ship.
There under the flying spray three seamen were at work,
desperately trying to loosen the two halves of the broken
mainyard, which had smashed through the bulwarks and
wedged there. Deakin leaped upon the three and struck
them aside, his men knocked them into the surging tide
below. Whirling, Deakin spat orders at his own three.</p>

<p>“Go get some food, a fusil, and dry powder—sharp
about it! Strip some tarpaulin off the guns below and
fetch it. Move fast, blast ye! She’s breakin’ up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>Breaking up she was. Wounded men were going to
leeward, clinging to bits of wreckage, swimming frantically
in the icy water, pulling each other down. The
Bostonnais hurled himself at the two fragments of the
great spar lodged in the bulwarks. His immense strength
prised them free, he tore at other flotsam, stood guard over
it all until one by one his three men came staggering back
to the spot with their burdens. One bore food and a fusil,
another had powder and ball and pistols, the third brought
tarred canvas.</p>

<p>Deakin sent them after line, and got the powder, weapons
and food all firmly lashed inside roll after roll of the
tarpaulin. Then the four men flung to work at the spars
and wreckage, and in ten minutes accomplished more
than the green hands with Smithsend on the poop could
effect in an hour’s time. They were seasoned men, knowing
what fate faced them unless they gripped at the forelock
of destiny—therefore they grasped hard and sure,
without pity.</p>

<p>They got the little raft into the water, loaded their precious
burden aboard, and caught hold of the lines on each
side. She floated high. Next moment men were around
them, pleading, yelling, fighting for a shred of the visible
hope. Moses Deakin, towering above them with a jagged
splinter of rail of his hand, struck them down. His voice
boomed, and they were off, all four men swimming,
drifting inshore with the wind and current.</p>

<p>Still other men came clustering about, dark figures
pouring out of the broken wreck as ants pour forth from
a burning log. Wounded men, company servants and
seamen, one or two Frenchmen; Deakin and his men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
silently watched them come, then struck out grimly and
mercilessly, beat off the hapless refugees, kept their raft
ever pushing ahead over the shallows, leaving in their
wake a mournful wail of despairing voices that followed
them down the wind. The four quickly overtook and
passed the first stragglers, resolutely shoved onward,
pausing only to smite down one or two who sought the
help of their float. Thus they had covered nearly a mile
when Deakin uttered a relieved grunt.</p>

<p>“Shoal! Down feet.”</p>

<p>They let themselves down, found the water shoulder-high,
presently only waist-high. At this level it remained
for another two miles, and they dragged the float by the
lines. Moses Deakin was in the lead, bent over, straining
at the ropes with his immense strength, nostrils flaring as
he sniffed the shore. Soon this came into sight ahead, the
low ground dark with trees. In twenty minutes the four
men were carrying their burdens up from the water, staggering
through snow and shore ice up to the line of
trees, where they sank down in absolute exhaustion.</p>

<p>“No time to waste here,” panted the Bostonnais, gazing
into the storm and wiping the spray from his face, his
great beard heaving above his chest. “We’re seven or
eight leagues east o’ Nelson. No use goin’ west—such o’
them fools as gets ashore will all head that way.”</p>

<p>“Then where the devil do we head for—New Severn?”
demanded one of the three rogues, ironically.</p>

<p>“Ay, New Severn.”</p>

<p>“The English company hath a gallows there, master.”</p>

<p>Deakin glared from bloodshot eyes at the objector.
Then, realizing the need for patience, he stooped and drew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
with his finger in the sand a rough right angle, indicating
the line of the shore to the west.</p>

<p>“Now look ’ee! We be forty league south o’ Danish
river. How be we to get there? Not by walking, wi’ the
woods full o’ French and English dogs! Besides, by the
shore ’tis more like eighty leagues than forty. Therefore,
turn toward Severn. Ye fool, we may not have a mile to
go! We’ll find redskins anywhere about here, at the first
creek we come by, and Injun canoes too. They’re all
down at the coast for the trade, them that don’t live here.
Follow the coast east and we’ll come on ’em, certain.
Then we ha’ the tarpaulins for sails to our canoe. Blood
and wounds! Get a canoe and head north—what better
d’ye want? Canoe can go over the shallows—French
ships must go six leagues out to sea to find a draft o’
seven fathom! D’ye get it in your thick head?”</p>

<p>“Ay, master——”</p>

<p>“Keep it there, then.” Deakin knocked the man
sprawling and leaped to his feet. “Shanks’ mare and
away! The storm be falling by to-night, most like.”</p>

<p>The four men rose and went lurching off along the edge
of the trees, following the low line of the shore and keeping
their eyes open for the first sign of a creek. Half
frozen though they were, they dared not linger here to
light a fire.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, with the strong set of currents bearing it
eastward along the coast, all the tangled top-hamper of
the wreck drifted away, and in the midst of it was Crawford.
So it happened that the four men, staggering onward
by the shore, came upon this tangle of lines and
spars, grounded upon a shallow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>Crawford was alive and awake by this time, but there
was scarce enough life in his brain to admit any impressions;
his body was quite helpless, sodden garments fast
frozen to the maintop that held him above water, and
waves still breaking over him. None the less, he dimly
comprehended that there was clear sunlight overhead, and
that the tempest was over. So he was not dead after all!
Not dead, yet not far from it; and evidently dreaming,
since there dimly pierced to his senses, as though from
some great distance, the brazen tones of Moses Deakin.</p>

<p>“What, ye will not? Blood and wounds, but I say ye
shall! Into the water, all of ye! In, and haul him ashore.
But for him ye’d be frozen stark in irons this minute, ye
rogues; and Moses Deakin pays tit for tat. Move sharp,
or I’ll bash your lousy heads!”</p>

<p>Crawford tried to see who spoke, but his feeble gaze
could comprehend only ice and water. The spars and
wreckage surged. Then in front of him he beheld a fragment
of jagged wood upflung, and it came toppling at him,
nor could he move a muscle to avoid it. Down it came,
crashed him across the head and forced him under the
water, and again his eyes closed and he knew no more.</p>

<p>After this, he had a strange vision. A delicious pain
ran through his whole body as warmth crept into it, and
soft fingers of women were dressing his hurts, and he was
sipping hot broth. He saw around him strange dark faces
which he took for Indians. Not the redskins he had
known in New York, but flatter-faced people, lacking the
pride and fierceness of the Iroquois, sloven with dirt.
Then all this drifted away again on the wings of sleep.</p>

<p>With his next awakening, however, Crawford was himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
in mind if not in body, and though his head was
heavily bandaged, his senses were clear enough. He
awoke to warmth, and sunlight flooding above sparkling
wave-crests, and the slow rise and fall and surge of a
craft under sail. He perceived that he was sitting propped
up amidships in a long canoe; behind his shoulders was a
pole, to either end of which was lashed a bit of plank.
These planks went down into the water on each side of
the canoe, acting in place of centreboard. The craft was
speeding forward under a good breeze, was heading to the
north, and her sail was made from patched tarpaulin.
Two men, at first strangers to Crawford, were lying asleep
in the bow; but presently he recognized them for two of
Moses Deakin’s men. From behind him sounded the
rumbling tones of Deakin himself, conversing with another.</p>

<p>“Ay, that’s the wreck of Iberville’s ship down yonder.
She’s a good two leagues off the land, and the same from
the fort. Smoke i’ the trees means that some o’ them have
got safe ashore, plague blister them!”</p>

<p>“We’d ha’ better chance for life with them than i’ the
wilderness,” grumbled the unseen man. “What be the use
o’ making Danish river, Master? Injuns won’t be there
this time o’ year, and we have no ship.”</p>

<p>“How know ye that, ye rogue?” snapped Deakin
fiercely, then laughed. “No Injuns? Wait and see. If
they ha’ word for me from the Star Woman, they’ll be
there waiting. As for the ship, we left three men aboard
her. Soon’s the ice let her free, they’d bring her across
the bay to our old place. We have only to wait. And if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
they come not, what then? Why, make the best of it!
Blood and wounds, can we not winter with the redskins?
Or we can come south again after the fighting’s done and
take a craft from one o’ the forts. As for that, the Star
Woman herself may well be waiting to meet me, as I bade
her! Hark—ay, that devil Iberville is safe ashore! Hear
the great gun from the fort, eh? Likely Iberville is hammering
at the gate with his naked fists.”</p>

<p>The dull note of a distant cannon rolled to them from
the distant forested shore.</p>

<p>So it was no dream, and he was alive! Crawford relaxed
and closed his eyes again. He could realize that
Moses Deakin had saved him, could dimly grasp that it
had been done to repay his own act in setting the Bostonnais
free. He could even figure out to some extent all
that had passed, since Deakin was now heading for the
Danish river. But nothing mattered. Weariness returned
upon him, and despite the hunger gnawing at his vitals,
he fell back into slumber.</p>

<p>Then oaths and wild curses, with a brazen roar of maniacal
fury from Moses Deakin, wakened him some time
afterwards and brought him wide-eyed. The four men in
the canoe were pouring forth a storm of bitter imprecations,
which for once were sincerely heartfelt. Crawford,
seeing the men in the bow shaking fists to starboard,
turned his head.</p>

<p>There, far out beyond the shallows that hedged the
whole low coast, he descried the white sails of three tall
ships heading to the southward, and a little behind them
the brown canvas of a corvette. This, as the raging curses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
of his companions informed him, was no other than the
<i>Albemarle</i>. Presently the distant roll of a cannon reached
them, and another.</p>

<p>“Ay, they’ve seen us, and much good it’ll do them.
The French ha’ got our ship, eh?” Moses Deakin faced
the issue squarely. “Never mind that, lads, never mind!
On to the Danish, and we’ll find the redskins waiting for
us. We’ll find the Star Woman there too, or a message
from her. They’ll be sure to wait all summer, until the
ice comes again—ha! Art awake, Crawford? Here’s
food and drink, such as we ha’ got left. Don’t move too
much, for this cursed craft of ours is cranky.”</p>

<p>“One o’ the French ships ha’ sent a pinnace after us!”
yelled a man. “See her bit o’ sail, master?”</p>

<p>Deakin cursed, then laughed, for it was close to sunset.</p>

<p>“Sink me, let ’em come! No bluff-bowed navy boat
can keep up wi’ this canoe, and they’ll be glad to give over
the chase before dark. Here y’are, Crawford——”</p>

<p>Crawford thankfully ate and drank, while the canoe
plunged on. The pursuing sail was lost to sight ere twilight,
and when a small river appeared on their left,
Deakin held the canoe in for it. He wanted to renew their
scanty supply of fresh water and give all hands half an
hour ashore, as well as to rearrange their makeshift sail.</p>

<p>Upon landing, one of the men took the fusil and departed
after game, presently returning with a rabbit. A
fire was set going, and all five gathered about it. Crawford
was weak, but long sleep had refreshed him and the
weakness would soon pass, while his split scalp was already
healing beneath soothing Indian unguents. When
the five had polished off the last drop of broth and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
last scrap of meat from the boiled bones, a remnant of
tobacco was shared.</p>

<p>“Now—what!” demanded Crawford, meeting the wide
gaze of Moses Deakin. The latter, having learned Crawford’s
tale by snatches, grimaced in his beard.</p>

<p>“As to you? Well, I said ye were a warlock, and it’s
proved true. Another eight leagues, and we’ll land to
cut across Cape Churchill. No use rounding that shore
when we can save time and food by legging it. As for
you, we’re square. I’ve paid ye tit for tat.”</p>

<p>“Granted,” said Crawford. “You’ve not seen my ship
or men?”</p>

<p>“Nay. Will ye come with us?”</p>

<p>Crawford smoked out his scanty allotment of tobacco.</p>

<p>“Agreed,” he said, wondering whether he would find
Frontin at the Danish river. If Frontin had read that
scrap of blood-stained paper, had brought the <i>Northstar</i>
to the place—then what? If there were no south sea passage,
what lay in the future? Was the horizon empty?
Crawford put his hand inside his shirt and pulled forth
the Star of Dreams, still safe on its thong. The other
men blinked at the green jewel in the firelight.</p>

<p>“Agreed,” repeated Crawford. “I’m with you, Cap’n
Deakin. We’ll see what haps at the Danish river.”</p>

<p>“Ay,” growled Deakin, and rose. “All hands! Let’s
get off while the wind holds.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

PREDICTIONS AND EVENTS ARE SOMETIMES RECONCILED</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the twilight of another summer’s night, with the
barely sunken sun again rising, Moses Deakin and
Crawford and three men of Boston town, once enemies
but now strangely friends and allies against disaster,
came upon the river which white men called the Danish,
striking it two miles above the magnificent harbour.</p>

<p>The five men, crossing overland from the other side of
Cape Churchill, had met not a soul on their trail through
the woods, and for this there was good reason. In ancient
days the tribes had found a great ship floating here,
full of dead white men and wonderful things, and they
gathered around by scores to thaw out frozen boxes and
barrels; but certain of the kegs held powder. So ship and
dead men and redskins went thundering up in ruin, and
now the Indians called this the River of Strangers, and
shunned the bay in legendary fear and horror.</p>

<p>There in the landlocked harbour under Point Eskimo,
stout Jens Munck had watched his Danish colonists die,
had gone four days without food, knew himself dying of
scurvy, and so sat down to pen the last line in his log-book.
And what a trumpet call of the spirit he wrote
there! “Herewith, good night to all the world; and my
soul to God.” Yet he lived, and lived to work one ship
back to Norway, two staggering men helping him. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
Danish river had known heroes in those days, ay, and
was to know heroes often enough in days to come!</p>

<p>So Crawford and the four with him started down the
river bank toward the harbour, following the course of
the wide stream. As they went, Moses Deakin fired the
fusil and pistols again and again in the air, and sent his
stentorian voice ringing up among the trees, lifting brazen
curses because neither his agent, who was a Creek chief,
nor any other redskin appeared. If they had any message
from the Star Woman, they would not dare go away
until it was delivered; and while they would not camp at
the feared bay itself, they would remain near by and keep
out scouts to watch for Deakin.</p>

<p>Crawford, who was by this time well again save for his
half-healed scalp, said naught of his own hopes but smiled
to himself. He was looking forward eagerly to seeing the
bark lie anchored in the harbour, and to meeting Frontin.
Surely Frontin must hear those shots, and the ringing
bellow of Deakin, and the wild yells in which the other
men joined! As the five wended downstream, the huge
Bostonnais glared at the thick forest which closed in
everything, and cursed the Indians who did not appear.</p>

<p>“Why aren’t the red devils on hand to meet us?” he
roared forth at length, as they came to a bit of more
open shore, girded by trees and brush. “They’ve never
failed afore this! They bring down the furs, camp in a
village somewhere near at hand, across the bay, and keep
scouts posted for first sight o’ me. Blood and wounds,
where are the red dogs? Ahoy, ye rogues! Wake up!”</p>

<p>From the green trees that closed down like a wall, came
a low and mocking burst of laughter. The five men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
halted and stared about in startled astonishment. Swift
upon the heels of that laugh rose a voice in English.</p>

<p>“Thanks for warning us, Moses Deakin! At him,
lads——”</p>

<p>The trees vomited powder-smoke, the roar of fusils
echoed out, then a riot of figures came bursting forth from
ambush. The man in front of Crawford fell, riddled by
balls. The huge figure of Deakin swayed and tottered and
crashed to earth; the man at Deakin’s heels screamed out
as a cutlass split his skull. Then Crawford and the other
remaining man were down beneath a mass of assailants,
and eager hands bound them fast. So swift and deadly
was this assault that not a blow was struck in return.</p>

<p>Deakin, unconscious from a bullet that had raked
across his brow, was bound and carried off; after him,
Crawford and the other man were dragged. Crawford
stared at his captors in stupefied bewilderment. Frontin,
indeed! These were utter strangers, English by their
talk, and in command of them one Captain Moon. The
name struck Crawford with enlightenment. Aboard the
prize, he had heard Smithsend mention the little brig
<i>Perry</i>, under this same Captain Moon—an unit of the
company’s fleet which had presumably foundered in the
straits.</p>

<p>When the party emerged from the trees and came out
upon the shores of the landlocked harbour, Crawford
stared yet harder. There, inside the north point, lay the
broken wreck of a small ship, beyond doubt the <i>Perry</i>;
she had split her keel on the outer rocks and had been
swept inside, a total loss. Waiting beside the huge piles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
of salvaged barrels and goods were Indians—lordly Crees
and men of the bay-shore tribes, a good fifty of them at
least.</p>

<p>These were sitting about in a half-circle facing the
shore and the wreck, and it became evident that Moon
had interrupted a council to go and lay his ambush. Perhaps
the redskins here assembled had been friends to
Moses Deakin in other days, but now their prodigality of
gewgaws and blankets showed that Moon had spent much
of his precious salvage to win them over, and none of
them moved from their serried rank to greet the Bostonnais.</p>

<p>Now Moon, after giving his men orders, went with his
lieutenant to rejoin the waiting Indians. Deakin was
placed against a tree and lashed fast to it, Crawford was
dragged to another—and then Deakin’s one surviving
man broke free and made a dash for safety. He was
shot down before he had gone twenty feet, and died there.
Crawford offered no resistance, and was glad enough to be
mistaken for one of Deakin’s crew, lest worse befall him.
If he were posted in Boston as a pirate, news of him must
have reached London ere this. He stood bound to the
tree and surveyed the scene before him, while Moses
Deakin hung in his lashings, and the eighteen men who
survived the wreck sat to one side talking and smoking,
watching their officers parley with the redskins.</p>

<p>Moon, speaking in a mixture of French and English,
demanded that the Indians supply him with canoes and
guides down the coast, and that they follow him to Nelson
with their beaver. There was some hitch about this.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
Crawford could not uncover it, nor could Moon, until at
last a chief arose, threw aside his blanket, and spoke in
excellent French.</p>

<p>“We have a message for the Big Bear,” and he pointed
to the figure of Moses Deakin. “We have traded with
the Bostonnais because the Anglais have not come here.
Now the Anglais have very strong medicine. They have
destroyed the ship of the Big Bear, have killed his men,
have captured him. We shall trade with them, and bring
the packs of castor from our camp across the bay. But
first we must give this message to the Big Bear. This
message has been brought to the Crees from far away,
by a chieftain of the Sauteurs or Chippewas, who had it
from another nation called Nadouisioux. If this message
is not delivered to the Big Bear, our father Kitchimanitou
who lives in the sun will be displeased and will hide
his face from us, because this message comes from his
daughter the Star Woman.”</p>

<p>At this name, Crawford started. Moon, who did not
know what to make of this talk about a message, made a
curt response.</p>

<p>“Big Bear is to be hanged.”</p>

<p>“That is good,” said the Cree chief. “But first let him
receive this message, if he will accept it.”</p>

<p>Moon had no choice but to obey, and ordered his men
to revive the senseless Deakin. Crawford watched in
wondering surmise. Beyond a doubt, then, the Star
Woman was no Indian myth, but a real person! Deakin’s
insolent summons had gone to her, passed from
tribe to tribe—and here was the answer to be delivered!</p>

<p>Now Moon strode over to the two captives, gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
Crawford one curious glance, then turned his attention
to Deakin. The latter, under the impact of icy
water from the bay, was glaring and blinking around,
helpless to move; a furious thing he was, and grim to behold,
all his grizzled beard being dribbled and matted
with blood from his wounded forehead. Moon stood
laughing at him.</p>

<p>“It was kind of ye to give us warning wi’ shot and
shout!” he exclaimed. “Well, Moses Deakin, shalt have
thy head lying in salt when we leave here; the company
hath twenty pound on those moustachios. And why?
For that broadside ye poured into us last year i’ the
straits, and killed poor Cap’n Allen—ay, into a royal
navy ship too! Dost mind how ye slid out from among
the bergs and poured in shot, and went scooning down
the wind and away? Ay, and now that work is to cost
ye a head.”</p>

<p>The Bostonnais spat at his tormentor.</p>

<p>“That for ye, and the pox to boot!” he roared. “Ye’ll
never have my head! It’s no hand of man can bring me
to death, but only the gift of a woman——” Deakin
swallowed hard, then suddenly recollected everything.
“Hark, cap’n! We be from the south, wi’ great news.
Iberville ha’ whipped the company’s fleet, and by now is
master of Nelson——”</p>

<p>“What else, liar?” exclaimed Moon, laughing.</p>

<p>“Nay, ’tis truth! Ask Crawford, here. And what hope
have ye, with your ship gone? There is one man can
guide ye out, can bring ye safe south again to Albany or
New Severn—and that’s Moses Deakin. Come, I’ll bargain
with ye——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>Captain Moon roared with laughter, whereat Deakin
lost temper and caused Moon to roar anew.</p>

<p>“Iberville indeed! There are no French on the bay,
ye rascal pirate! If there were, they’d be soon enough
swept away——”</p>

<p>This disbelief maddened Deakin, who cursed and raved
like a maniac, until presently the officer quieted him with
a word.</p>

<p>“These redskins have a message for ye from one called
the Star Woman. Do ye want it or not, afore we hang
ye?”</p>

<p>Deakin stared, sobered suddenly, swallowed his wrath.
“Be that truth?”</p>

<p>“Ay.” Moon surveyed him curiously. “Who’s this
Star Woman?”</p>

<p>“Sink me if I know,” growled Deakin, with a sidelong
glance at Crawford. Moon shrugged, and ordered his
men to loose both prisoners from the trees. This was
done. Their arms were tied, and they were led to the
circled ranks of red warriors, who met Deakin’s glare
with impassive countenances. Deakin and Crawford sat
down, with Moon standing beside them. Behind clustered
the company men, but at a little distance.</p>

<p>“Keep your mouths shut, now,” warned Moon. “What’s
that chief getting his pipe for?”</p>

<p>“To smoke the sun,” growled Deakin in reply.</p>

<p>The leading Cree chief produced a much-adorned calumet,
and now proceeded to smoke the sun. This had
nothing whatever to do with a peace smoke, and was only
done on occasions of solemnity. Presenting the calumet
thrice to the rising sun, he then held it aloft in both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
hands and with it followed the course of the sun in the
sky, chanting a prayer for happiness and favour; this
done, he smoked for a moment, and handed the pipe to
another chief, who repeated the ceremony. Half a dozen
chiefs in all went through this ritual, then the pipe was
laid away. The Cree chief produced a bundle of close-tied
pelts, and stood up to address Moses Deakin.</p>

<p>“Last year my brother Big Bear gave us a message to
deliver. That message was delivered. Here is the answer
to that message. The hands of my brother Big Bear are
tied. I give this belt to the hand of my brother the
Anglais, that he may bring it to the sight of Big
Bear.”</p>

<p>Moon stepped forward to take the roll of skins from the
chief. At this moment Crawford, who was intent on the
ceremony, was startled to catch the low voice of Deakin
at his ear.</p>

<p>“Quick! When I grab ’un, kick fusils into water.”</p>

<p>It was no time to question whatever desperate plan
Deakin had in mind, or to ask how he was to grab any
one with his arms bound. Crawford glanced around. He
saw that the company men, grouped behind and to one
side, had stacked their fusils in two piles at the edge of
the water. The guns were but ten feet distant.</p>

<p>Crawford gathered his muscles in readiness to spring,
and then waited, tensed.</p>

<p>Captain Moon took the bundle of skins from the chief,
half turned, and stood frowning. Then he sat down so
that Deakin was on one side of him and the circle of redskins
on the other, unsheathed his knife, and cut the
thongs that bound the skins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>“Ay,” said Deakin, straining forward, his wide nostrils
flaring. “Open it!”</p>

<p>The officer did so, to disclose inner wrappings of doe-skin,
likewise thonged. These gave place to yet a third
wrapping—this time of soft, thick grey fur that drew
from Moon an exclamation of astonishment. It was a
white beaver pelt. The Indians, no less than the whites,
were watching with intense interest, and from them came
a chorus of grunts at sight of the white beaver. Then, as
Moon drew this open, to disclose the heart of the whole
business, white men and red stared in silence—the one in
puzzled wonder, the other in comprehension.</p>

<p>The message from the Star Woman was a short, heavy
arrow with fine thin head of barbed iron. The arrow was
painted red. The insolent message of Moses Deakin had
been answered, significantly enough, by a war-arrow.</p>

<p>“What’s it mean?” demanded Moon, fingering it.</p>

<p>Deakin caught his breath for sheer rage, unable to
speak. He knew well enough that all his dreaming had
crashed down in this instant, with this response displayed
to all eyes; he had hoped for a very different sort of message.
Perhaps he had thought that, under its influence,
the Indians would rise to his aid. Now, in those bronzed
features circled around him, he saw only a stolid hostility.
Big Bear had lost his medicine and the Anglais had overcome
him; also the Star Woman had doomed him to
death. The chiefs would shun this doomed creature,
leave him to meet the fate which the dreaded Star Woman
had decreed for him. That fate was death.</p>

<p>All this Moses Deakin beheld in the ring of faces, while
Moon frowned down at the arrow and the white beaver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
pelt. Then, suddenly, the bloodshot eyes of Moses Deakin
dilated. His face under the matted beard purpled,
his brow pulsed with knotted veins, and his shoulders
heaved up.</p>

<p>“Ready, Crawford!” burst from him, as the sea-rotted
hemp burst away from his mighty arms. “Blood and
wounds—got ’un!”</p>

<p>With one hand he seized Moon by the neck, drawing
him close, and the other great paw gripped the knife in
Moon’s hand. Crawford, despite bound arms, shot to
his feet.</p>

<p>No one save the watching, impassive Indians realized
what was happening. The company men saw only Deakin
seizing their skipper, while Crawford leaped up and darted
to the piled fusils and began to kick them into the water.
Then indeed the men sprang up cursing and shouting—but
the brazen voice of Deakin bellowed out and held them
motionless.</p>

<p>“One move, ye dogs, and your skipper dies!”</p>

<p>Lieutenant and men huddled there, staring, all adread,
and no wonder. There seemed something frightful and
unearthly about this shaggy, blood-smeared figure that
had suddenly burst his bonds and uprisen like some prehistoric
monster, holding or rather hugging, bear-fashion,
the frantically writhing Captain Moon—gripping the
man’s whole throat in one gnarled paw, lifting him from
his feet, glaring above him at the staring men. The Indians
sat motionless, still tense from the sight of that war-arrow,
holding themselves aloof.</p>

<p>“To me, Crawford!” rang out the stentorian voice.</p>

<p>Crawford, his task accomplished, now came back to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
side of Deakin, while Moon’s men dared not lift a finger
lest the knife bite their skipper. To be a company captain
meant much; each captain was to his men as a little
god, something a trifle more than human, whose slightest
word was law ordained. Now, with his knife, Deakin
slashed the bonds of Crawford.</p>

<p>“Weapons—then to the trees.”</p>

<p>Free, Crawford leaped at the men who gave back before
him. From one he caught a hangar, from the gaping
lieutenant a gold-decked rapier, perhaps brought out
from London as a gift for Governor Bailey at Nelson.
Then back to Deakin, now retreating slowly toward the
trees, backing around the circle of intent redskins, snarling
as he gripped his limp captive.</p>

<p>Then from the lieutenant burst horrified words.</p>

<p>“The cap’n—dead! At ’em—cut ’em off!”</p>

<p>Indeed, what had been Captain Moon was now a poor
dead thing, head horribly askew in that fierce grip.
Moses Deakin had defeated himself. The men’s stupefaction
fled. A yell broke from them and they flooded
forward. Deakin dropped his victim, seized the hangar
from Crawford.</p>

<p>“Too late!” he snarled. “Another minute——”</p>

<p>Too late indeed; a pistol roared, and Deakin staggered
as the ball hipped him. Crawford might have run for it,
but that was not his way; a laugh broke on his lips and
he halted. The Bostonnais, knife and cutlass in hand,
stood like a bear at bay. Crawford made one desperate
effort to stay the onrush.</p>

<p>“Hold, men! Your fleet’s destroyed—Nelson is captured—your
only chance is——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>A howl of fury drowned his words and the company
men closed in, wielding hangars, knives, clubbed muskets,
anything and everything. Deakin’s hand moved, and the
knife sang through the air; the lieutenant, blade through
gullet, pitched down and lay still.</p>

<p>Crawford saw why those fusils had been kicked into
the water, for with the firearms the company men would
have picked off the two and shot them down. Now, back
to back, Deakin and Crawford met the rush with whistling
cutlass and delicate rapier; as the maddened crowd
closed in blindly, men died by point and edge, for the
only cool heads there were the two who faced their doom
unafraid. Rapier slithered in and out, hangar crashed and
whirled and thudded again, and the laugh of Crawford
echoed the roaring bellow of the Bostonnais. The ranks
of redskins, leaping up, watched the fight with gleaming
eyes and low grunts of astonishment.</p>

<p>The company men soon had enough of this, for three of
them were gasping at death and others were reeling away;
they fell back, yelling at one another to close in yet none
caring to be the first. Deakin bawled a laugh at them,
pressing one hand to his thigh, but Crawford, eyeing that
ring of fierce faces, smiled thinly.</p>

<p>“Your prophecy was right, Deakin,” he panted. “Had
it not been for that gift from the Star Woman, we might
have——”</p>

<p>Deakin hurled curses at the watching chiefs who refused
him aid, broke off short to dodge a hurled axe—and
the circle was closing in again. This time more cautiously,
clubbed fusils and bits of wreckage battering down while
the holders stood beyond reach of hangar and rapier.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
One man came in too far, and Deakin split his skull—but
a gun-butt struck the giant over the head and staggered
him. Like wolves they leaped upon him and had him
down, and the writhing, heaving mass of men went rolling
across the sand.</p>

<p>Crawford, ringed in, stood alone. An oar swept at him.
He dodged it, leaped into action, flung himself at the
circle about him, rapier licking in and out and sending
men to cough their lives out—but a cutlass clashed on
the thin blade and slithered it. Then they dragged at
him, overwhelmed him; but those men worked their own
ill. Crowding too close to get in straight blows, they
gave Crawford a chance to work free, and he seized it.
Next instant he was on his feet, his fists hammering them
back. From the sand he caught up a cutlass, broke
through them, found himself clear. Clear, yes—but at
the water’s edge, with the icy bay behind him and the
ring of sullen, fury-filled men closing him in.</p>

<p>They were content to let him rest there a moment, for
into the edge of their circle burst the writhing heap of
men above Deakin. Twice Deakin hurled them clear,
and twice they were in upon him before he could rise.
Then, streaming with blood, battered and blind and a
fearful thing to see, the giant came to one knee, gripping
a screaming man in either hand. Inarticulate bellows
foaming from his red-frothed lips, Deakin tore out the
throat of the man in his right hand, and yelled madly.
The other man, shrieking in awful panic, caught something
from the sand in groping fingers and drove it home.
Deakin lifted his great red paw and struck the man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
down, then clutched at his breast. He fell backward, one
terrible gasp breaking from his lips. From his breast
stood out the red shaft of the Star Woman’s gift. There
died Moses Deakin of Boston.</p>

<p>From Crawford’s throat pealed up the wild yell of the
Iroquois, the war whoop of the Mohawk tribe:</p>

<p>“<i>Sassakouay! Sassakouay!</i>”</p>

<p>That yell lifted and swirled among the trees. The
dread, well-known sound of it evoked a wild and startled
response of whoops from the watching chieftains. At
this, the circle of blood-maddened men hung back, thinking
that the redskins were about to take them in the rear,
but quickly regained confidence. They spat curses, and
lifted weapons anew.</p>

<p>Crawford faced them, yet saw them not. He was spent,
and knew it well, and queer visions came whirling at him
as he reeled, dazed and battered. He saw the face of
Iberville greet him with one flashing smile ere it faded;
he saw Moses Deakin, wide-nostriled, glaring upon him
as the shade of Aias glared balefully upon the crafty Odysseus;
he saw the faces of dead men whom he had known
in other days, drawing in upon him, fading, passing away.
And as he stood there, leaning dazedly upon the hangar,
the Star of Dreams came out from his shirt and swayed.
Sight of that green jewel halted the indrawing circle of
men, halted them in sheer astonishment, held them staring
for an instant. Then Crawford’s vision cleared. He saw
one wild ruffian heave up a fusil to drive down upon him—and
with a laugh he whirled the hangar and sent it
hurtling point first into the ruffian’s breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>Then they closed in upon him as he swayed, empty-handed.
As they came, it seemed to him that he saw the
face of Frontin, and heard the voice of Frontin ringing
wildly in his ears. He took it for a welcoming to the
other world—the world beyond the horizon—as he went
down under the blows.</p>

IT IS ONLY BY CROOKED LANES THAT ONE GAINS THE
HIGHWAY</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the shore of that landlocked harbour at the
mouth of the Danish river, where after another
snow or two was to rise the palisaded front of
Fort Churchill, was now being enacted a curious scene
before the astonished and startled eyes of the assembled
redskins, who had held their places only from a sense of
dignity—and because they had nowhither to run.</p>

<p>Lying bound at the water’s edge were six men—all that
remained from the company of the wrecked ship in the
shallows. The others lay as they had fallen, from the
savage attack of those men who came bursting from the
trees—Frontin and Sir Phelim Burke, with those who
followed them. Crawford, helped by two of his men,
doused the icy water over face and head, cleared his eyes
and rose, and gripped the hands of his friends.</p>

<p>“A miracle!” he said. “You say Serigny captured the
corvette? What miracle——”</p>

<p>“Devil a bit of it,” exclaimed Phelim Burke. “We
saw that canoe of yours heading north along the coast—Frontin
declared that he recognized you, through the
glass. So Serigny gave us a boat and we came after you.
Did ye not hear the gun fired?”</p>

<p>“Serigny—gave you a boat?” Crawford stared hard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>“He wanted the corvette, would not give it up,” said
Frontin, frowning a little. “My faith, he meant to hang
the lot of us offhand! But I had a talk with him.” For
one instant, the cynical visage of the man was clouded
by an unwonted embarrassment. “You comprehend,
cap’n, in another day and another world, I likewise had
another name. Well, to the devil with all explanations!
Facts are facts. I talked with Serigny, and though he’d
not give up the corvette he gave us a boat, so there we
were—and here we are. We landed where you did, followed
your trail, and got here in time to put some shot
into those rascals.”</p>

<p>Crawford nodded. His head was clear enough now,
and he perceived that instant action was needed. Ignoring
his hurts for the moment, he forced himself to stride
across the sand to where the circle of chieftains waited.
They stared at him, at the blazing star hanging on his
breast; and when he sat down and addressed them in
French, they also sat down and listened.</p>

<p>“My brothers have seen that the medicine of Big Bear
failed, and that the medicine of the Anglais also failed.
Why? Because of my medicine.” As Crawford held up
the emerald star, grunts broke from the warriors. They
could understand this. “I have come to smoke the calumet
with my brothers from up-country.”</p>

<p>There was a silence. Frontin and Sir Phelim and the
other men drew in behind Crawford and waited. Then,
because they had no more tobacco, and had not yet obtained
any from the salvage, the head Cree chief produced
a calumet and stuffed the bowl with fragrant <i>sagacomi</i>
from his pouch. When he had lighted it, he handed it to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
Crawford, who puffed and returned it. So the council was
opened and the calumet smoked, and now Crawford, with
characteristic readiness, faced an instant decision.</p>

<p>He had already learned from Deakin that if Cree chiefs
were here, they would be here only in order to deliver the
message from the Star Woman. As a rule they came
far from their own country to the bay, in May or June,
and only that message would force them to come later or
delay them. It was obvious that these chiefs would be
now wildly anxious to be gone home. So, when the leading
chief had made a short and ceremonial address, he
sat down to await his answer. Crawford let him wait,
made his decision, then came stiffly to his feet and faced
them.</p>

<p>“My brothers, you know what has happened here, but
you do not know why I have come here. Look at this.”
Once more he held up the Star of Dreams. “I have come
because the Star Woman sent this to lead me to her. I
am going home with you. You will take me up-country
with you and then send me on to the Star Woman with
guides.”</p>

<p>Stifled grunts of awe and amazement sounded. Crawford
continued swiftly.</p>

<p>“My brothers, you have brought beaver for Big Bear.
It is of no use to me, but I will buy it from you. I will
give you all these goods from the wrecked ship, such as I
do not need, then you will cache the beaver here and
leave it until next year, or until I come again to get it.
To-morrow we will arrange these matters, and then we
will leave for your own country. Go to your camp, and
return here to-morrow. I have spoken.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>There was silence, while Crawford’s men stared at one
another, and the wounded men by the water groaned in
their bonds. Then, with silent acceptance of his words,
the chiefs broke up the council and departed among the
trees. No sooner were they gone, than Crawford swung
up and faced his men.</p>

<p>He looked at Frontin and met a dry smile. He looked
at Sir Phelim Burke and met a twinkle of the eye. He
looked at his men and then laughed suddenly.</p>

<p>“My lads, we have no ship. Our seafaring days are
ended, for we have crossed that horizon. Here is a
chance that has come to me, to go farther, where no
white men have gone, to see new things. I am going into
the unknown country with these Indians. I have learned
that the Star Woman is no myth, no legend, but actually
exists—and I’m going to find her. I don’t ask any of you
to come with me. There’s naught for you at the end of
this journey. If ye want to go to Fort Nelson, go freely.
In any case, I’ll loose these prisoners and let them go.
If ye come with me, I’ll be glad. Talk it over with your
comrades, Dickon. You with your men, Phelim——”</p>

<p>“Divil take the talk!” and Phelim Burke laughed out.
“These Burkes will do as I say, Hal Crawford, and ye
know my mind already. We’re with ye, if it’s into hell!”</p>

<p>“Ay, master!” spoke up the man Dickon, whilst his
comrades growled approval. “The horizon be as good one
place as another—and we be your men!”</p>

<p>Crawford looked at Frontin, his blue eyes all asparkle.</p>

<p>“And you, old buccaneer? Wilt go to Nelson and join
Serigny? Or wilt go——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>Frontin shrugged, but his affected cynicism could not
hide the quick glow in his dark countenance.</p>

<p>“I? Bah! Don’t be a fool. I go to get some soup
over the fire, and advise you to do the same——”</p>

<p>A roar of laughter broke the tension.</p>

IT DOES NOT PAY TO BE MERCIFUL</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> the story passes to a mid-afternoon of spring
in the far northwest, where as yet spring was
only a name of bitter mockery. Hal Crawford
and his men, with the terrified Cree guides who led them,
staggered over the snow-crust of a tree-girded valley,
along the open space which held a frozen stream hidden
beneath its ice and snow.</p>

<p>Far in the lead went the Cree trail-breaker. Crawford
followed him, and behind Crawford came Frontin.
The others, Indians and white men, straggled along as
best they could, Sir Phelim Burke bringing up the rear
and driving them on. As he wearily followed the Cree
on between the lines of dark trees, Crawford began to
feel the grip of hopeless despair—and with reason.</p>

<p>“Can do no more, lad!” rose the voice of Phelim Burke.
“Two men down.”</p>

<p>Crawford glanced back to the group of men and halted.</p>

<p>“Make camp and a fire,” he called. He met the eyes of
Frontin, but neither man spoke.</p>

<p>This valley ran from northeast to southwest. Crawford
looked back in the direction whence he had come,
and in his mind’s eye reviewed all the vast country across
which he had struggled during the winter months, working
from village to village, from tribe to tribe. Just behind
him he saw the country of the Crees; beyond that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
the villages of the Savanois or plains folk, those of the
Monsaunis or swamp tribes, and finally the scattered
groups of the Wenebigonhelinis or seashore people, who
lived about the edge of Hudson Bay. How far away now
seemed that bay, and the dead Moses Deakin!</p>

<p>Into the crawling wilderness had come this masterless
master of men, working ever to the west and south. Still
he heard new tales of the Star Woman, that half-mythical
person whom none had seen but of whom all knew, and
who was said to rule somewhere beyond—always beyond;
and as he quested forward, slowly winning his way from
tribe to tribe, from frozen swamp to frozen hills, the wild
tales gradually settled into more sober legends. Now it
appeared that the Star Woman was no ruler of vast regions,
but a woman of mystical power and influence, a
sorceress who lived somewhere near the country of the
Dacotah or Nadouisioux; yet even among far peoples, her
name was mighty. Ahead of Crawford flitted the word
that he sought this Star Woman, protecting him and gaining
guides. More, the Star of Dreams that hung upon his
breast had swiftly won him the respect and fear of the
tribes. To them it was medicine of the strongest, obviously
connected with the Star Woman, so that they held
Crawford as a man to be aided on his way to her and
furthered in all things.</p>

<p>Thus, at least, had gone events; but now he encountered
check.</p>

<p>He had sent ahead to get guides from the Stone Men,
or Assiniboines, but these had not met him; day after
day, only emptiness and bleak snow-desolation greeted
him, with no signal smokes on the horizon. The Crees had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
brought him into that debatable land which they termed
the abode of dancing dead men, where the blood of slain
folk and the power of devils made all things desolate,
where Cree and Stone Man disputed roving bands of
Sauteurs or Dacotahs from the south.</p>

<p>It was the dread seventh year, the year of famine, and
during the past four days the party had found no game,
not even a lone rabbit. Yet, on all sides of their line of
march, were recent snowshoe trails, so that the Crees
whispered of spirits and were sore adread. His little band
were weak with hunger and fatigue. The Englishmen
were terrified by this drear land, while the Irishmen talked
of banshees and good people. The Cree guides were now
held only by fear of Crawford and the dark Frontin;
when their fear of spirits bore down their fear of things
physical, they would decamp. Then what, in this drear
region which Crawford thought himself the first white man
to visit?</p>

<p>While Crawford stood there staring bleakly along the
valley, the answer came with unexpected suddenness.
The Cree trail-breaker had returned, passing Crawford
and Frontin, and rejoined the weary men about the fire.
From the trees just ahead, there rose a deep voice that
spoke in English.</p>

<p>“Crawford! Come for’ard and talk wi’ me.”</p>

<p>Frontin’s jaw fell. Crawford stared at the trees, utterly
aghast for an instant, until he saw a man step from the
trees and start forward, across an open space of a hundred
yards. A man—a white man!</p>

<p>“Devil take me! Is it real or a dream?” murmured
Frontin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>“Real.” Crawford came to life abruptly, recovering
from his astounded surprise. “Come.”</p>

<p>He started forward, and the other followed, staring.
The stranger was confidently forging toward them across
the snow, and was alone, apparently unarmed.</p>

<p>“Look at his ears!” said Frontin suddenly. “There’s
an animal for you, cap’n!”</p>

<p>The stranger was bareheaded, wore woollen shirt and
trousers, no furs. He was not tall, but very wide, thickly
built, long in the arm; his head was well set between
broad shoulders. His hair, cut close and ragged by a
knife, was a bright flame-colour, and his heavy features
ended in a pointed red beard. His skin, too, was red and
high-blooded, while his ears were set very high on his
head. He had all the look of a vigorous animal alive
with power, and his eyes were of a light grey, whitish
and almost colourless, but extremely sharp and alert.</p>

<p>The three came together. The stranger stood gazing
at the other two—Frontin, hawk-nosed and saturnine,
dark and grimly cynical; Crawford, thin and hatchet-faced,
his heavy-lidded blue eyes somehow expressing his
indomitable spirit. The stranger spoke abruptly.</p>

<p>“Which is Crawford? Workin’ for the French company?”</p>

<p>“I am Crawford, but I’m working for myself. Who
the devil are you?”</p>

<p>“My name’s Maclish, agent of the English company.”
Maclish spoke with a slight Scots burr. “I’ve had word
of your coming, and I’m here to send ye back.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Crawford. The other showed yellow fangs
in a laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>“Don’t understand it, eh? Thought you could come up-country
for the French and nobody know about it, eh?
Well, you’ll learn different.”</p>

<p>“I’m not for the French,” said Crawford.</p>

<p>“Don’t believe a word of it,” retorted Maclish cheerfully.
“After Iberville swept the north end o’ the bay
last year, I was at Albany with Kelsey. Lucky Iberville
couldn’t make a clean sweep o’ things! Well, we heard
that a fur-pirate named Crawford was heading inland
in French employ, so Kelsey sent me along to stop the
game. And I’m here. You know about Kelsey, maybe?”</p>

<p>Crawford shook his head.</p>

<p>“Kelsey broke out o’ bounds years ago and came up
among the Stone Men. He married a red princess and
brought down all the trade, so the company made him a
blooming lord in high command. And with a bit o’ luck,
I’ll be the same one o’ these days.”</p>

<p>Maclish paused to stuff a pipe. Crawford stood immobile,
his brain racing. So this man had overreached him—had
got ahead of him in the dead of winter! Amazing
as the fact was, bitter as it was, Crawford instantly gathered
himself to face the situation.</p>

<p>“So I’m not the first white man in this country?” he
asked, to gain time.</p>

<p>“Devil a bit of it. Kelsey’s first, I’m second, and next
year the company starts inland. The old orders are dead.
No more keeping the company servants cooped up! Iberville’s
cut us off from the north o’ the bay, so we’ll work
the East Main and the up-country. When your messages
came to the Assiniboines, asking for guides, I got ’em.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
Maclish puffed and chuckled complacently, obviously
pleased with himself.</p>

<p>“Pawky devils, those chiefs!” he went on. “They’re
afraid o’ the Star Woman, but they’re more afraid o’ losing
their trade—and not a cursed bit afraid o’ you and
your Crees! Besides, I’ve got the young warriors all with
me. I’ve heard tales about that Star Woman myself, and
I’ve an exploring commission from Kelsey; so here I am—and
back you go!”</p>

<p>Had not Maclish been so entirely self-satisfied, he might
have taken warning from the deadly cold manner of
Crawford.</p>

<p>Crawford, however, was far from sure of his course.
Had the Crees taken him south to the Lake Superior country,
he would have avoided the trap; instead, they had
brought him into this disputed region just south of the
Assiniboine country, declaring that the Star Woman lived
in that direction. While the Assiniboines, or Stone Men,
were in much awe of the Star Woman, they stood in no
fear of a strange white man seeking her. They had long
since been bound to the English cause through Kelsey,
and Maclish was clever enough to play his cards well.</p>

<p>“So I go back?” said Crawford.</p>

<p>“If you’re wise.” Maclish showed his yellow teeth.
“And I go on.”</p>

<p>“Eh? You go on?” Crawford’s eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>“Just that—to find the Star Woman my ain self!” Maclish
chuckled. “Until I learned of her, I thought to follow
Kelsey’s example and take a young squaw from among the
Stone Men; but not now. It’s a big chance, ay! How
much d’ye ken of her?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>“Little,” said Crawford shortly. His gaze was stabbing
at the trees around, but he could discern nothing at all.
Either Maclish had come alone, or had a force of men
hidden. Now Crawford understood those strange snowshoe
tracks that had been seen. He saw, too, that in this
red-faced agent of the English company he had to do
with a savage and resolute enemy. This fact cheered him
up somewhat, for Hal Crawford had his own way of dealing
with enemies.</p>

<p>But now Maclish waxed garrulous. No doubt the sound
of his own voice was good to him, after this winter spent
among the Stone Men.</p>

<p>“They’ve uncommon queer tales of her,” he went on.
“It seems that her people are the Dacotah, but she lives
somewhere on holy ground; any place where she is, I
gather, is holy. That’s the lay of it. A fine bonny
lass, I hear, wi’ blue eyes and a star of blue stones.
White blood in her, most like. Ay, it’s a big chance,
and ye may be sure the young men are all with Maclish!”</p>

<p>“What’s a big chance?” queried Crawford, anxious to
keep the man in talk.</p>

<p>“To marry her, o’ course! Ye ken, maybe, there’s war
between the Dacotah and the Stone Men? Ay. All those
western tribes down below are at war wi’ the Stone Men,
while the Sauteurs hang neutral. Those Dacotah, ye ken,
are kith and kin to the Stone Men; and they’re not so far
from here, neither. Well, I’ll marry her and then we’ll
drain all the trade out o’ French hands to the bay. All
those Lake Superior tribes will obey the Star Woman.
And then who’ll be the company’s lord, eh? Maclish, ye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
can lay to that! We’ll make peace among the tribes, and
Maclish bringin’ down the beaver!”</p>

<p>Crawford sensed only vaguely the tremendous purpose
behind the man, the far-reaching scheme which this Scot
had so shrewdly plotted. He was more actively concerned
with this actual news of the Star Woman. He had heard
much, during the winter, about those fierce tribes who
termed themselves by the proudly simple name of “The
Men,” and were known to others by the generic Algonquin
word Nadouisioux or Sioux, meaning “enemies.” Between
the Iroquois in the east and these Dacotah in the west, the
lesser red tribes were as corn between the grinders.</p>

<p>“So you intend to find her, do you?” asked Crawford.</p>

<p>“Ay. Only a few hours’ march from here is a place
they call the Spirit Lake—some sort of holy ground, it is.
The Stone Men tell me a message can reach her from
there; just how, I don’t rightly ken. But if a message
can reach her, then so can a man! So that’s the lay of it.
You’ll go back, and I’ll go on.”</p>

<p>Only a few hours’ march! Crawford laughed suddenly,
and his laugh brought crafty guile and alarm into the eyes
of Maclish.</p>

<p>“You fool!” said Crawford, a sudden blaze of anger in
his face. “You think to stop me, do you?”</p>

<p>“Right, cap’n,” said the voice of Frontin, and the dark
man smiled terribly. “Now’s the time to do the stopping.”</p>

<p>Maclish took a backward step, hastily.</p>

<p>“No, no! Will ye ha’ patience?” he cried out. “It’s
only a warning I’m giving ye, no more! If ye go for’ard,
it’s your ain fault, not mine! I ha’ naught to do with it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>Frontin thrust his dark features out.</p>

<p>“Hark to the liar and rogue!” said he. “Cap’n, there’s
bad guile in this fox. It’s in my mind to put a knife in
him here and now.”</p>

<p>Maclish, who had lost his swaggering confidence, held
out his empty hands.</p>

<p>“If I meant ye harm,” he said, “would I ha’ come without
a weapon to meet ye? If ye mean to murder me, go
ahead, then. If not, we’ll part on it and no more said.”</p>

<p>“Right,” said Crawford, with sudden decision. “Go
your way, and don’t cross my road again. I’m no murderer,
so be off.”</p>

<p>With this, Maclish turned and started for the trees up
the valley.</p>

<p>“Devil take me, but we did wrong to let him go!” said
Frontin.</p>

<p>Crawford shook his head. The two friends went side
by side toward their staring band of men, who had witnessed
this amazing meeting without having been able to
hear its import.</p>

<p>“No. The rascal changed his tune in a hurry, if you
noticed—and why? Because he must have few men with
him. He does not dare oppose us. Now, think! If that
Spirit Lake is only a short march away, we’ll be there
to-morrow. You heard what he said about reaching the
Star Woman. With luck, we’ll not need the Assiniboine
guides after all.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like it,” muttered Frontin. “I don’t like the
very name of these Stone Men!”</p>

<p>Crawford laughed shortly, and they met Sir Phelim
Burke and walked with him to the fire, telling of what had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
passed. Sir Phelim wrinkled up his nose and eyed the
trees.</p>

<p>“My word is to get out of this valley,” he declared.
“We’d best make no night camp with red dogs hanging
around. Here, ask the guides if they know about this
Spirit Lake!”</p>

<p>Crawford nodded. “Break camp!” he commanded
sharply, and beckoned one of the Crees. He was just
putting the question to the red man, when from the fringe
of trees there roared up the voice of Maclish.</p>

<p>“So I can’t stop ye, eh? Then take it, ye lousy
rogues——”</p>

<p>A musket crashed, and the Cree beside Hal Crawford
plunged and thrashed in the snow like a stricken partridge.</p>

<p>From the trees all around shrilled up a wild chorus of
yells. Another musket and another spoke out from that
encircling ring of unseen foes; then came a buzz and a
hum of loosened bowstrings, and shafts began to pour in
from the trees. It was not battle, it was murder. With
guns all fur-cased against the frost, unable to sight an
enemy, Crawford and his men could strike scarcely a blow.
The wild yells of the Stone Men, fierce cousins of the
fiercer Dacotah, pealed up in triumph and hideous mockery.</p>

<p>The five Cree guides died where they stood. An Englishman
coughed with an arrow through his gullet, and
lay reddening the snow. Sir Phelim Burke reeled up to
Crawford, a shaft protruding from his side.</p>

<p>“Got us, Hal!” he cried. “At them, lad——”</p>

<p>Crawford caught him as he fell, saw his helpless men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
dropping, heard the black curses of Frontin, knew that
he was utterly lost and all his men. Then, sudden as it
had burst, the treacherous storm was stilled. The voice
of Maclish lifted again from among the trees.</p>

<p>“There’s stoppage for ye, Crawford! Now sit ye down,
and I’ll talk a bit more with ye presently, when I get these
red devils quiet.”</p>

<p>Then fell silence, and ghastly horror on the valley
where the snow lay reddened. So suddenly had it all
passed, that save for the dead men the thing seemed like
a dream.</p>

<p>It was Frontin who took charge, his frost-blackened lips
cracking out oaths and commands, making the men pile
arms and gather around the fire. There was naught else
to do, for they were caught in the open and ringed around
with foes. Hal Crawford, for once, was incapable of
action, as he gently let Phelim Burke sink into the snow,
pillowed his head, and sat gazing into that scarred and
branded face which was now greying in death.</p>

<p>In this bleak land, with the great silence of the snow
barrens pressing down on the white horizon, Phelim
Burke’s broken body had come to its last peace. Crawford
chafed the cold hands, looked once at the dark
wound, and could say nothing. Then, presently, Burke’s
eyes fluttered open; a wistful smile came to his pallid
lips, and his fingers pressed those of Crawford.</p>

<p>“Hal! Nay, leave the arrow be. It hurts not.”</p>

<p>Crawford choked. This man was more to him than
his own father had ever been.</p>

<p>“Take it not so hard, lad; why, lad, what matter?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
said Burke. “I go joyful enough, be sure! The leg they
broke on the rack will hurt no more. And, Hal, have ye
ever known any man to live forever? Not I.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Phelim! If you’d not followed me here——”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” Phelim Burke smiled again, though sweat
dewed his cheeks. “I’ll wait for ye over the last horizon,
lad. Tush, now! It’s little enough to die—what else ha’
we lived for? If it was you, lad, ye’d go with a laugh.”</p>

<p>“But it’s you, Phelim—and I love you!”</p>

<p>“Ay, it’s me, save the mark! And if the blessed saints
will maybe lend me a hand, Hal, I’ll stay with ye till the
Star Woman’s found. Oh, lad, I’d like to see over that
horizon! Ay, I’ll stay with ye, for maybe she’s the woman
for ye after all. Mind ye keep the Star o’ Dreams safe,
since it’s in my mind that your fate lies in the jewel——”</p>

<p>His jaw fell for an instant, and he gasped. Then his
eyes opened wider, and he loosed Crawford’s hand and
reached out at the air in front of him. His childhood’s
tongue came back to him for the last moment.</p>

<p>“It’s not you that will be leaving me a long while alone,
Hal—and look—look! The sun’s growing brighter—<i>duar
na criosd!</i> Oh, the bright glory of it, and little
Eileen beckoning to me—oh, and she so beautiful, so
beautiful——”</p>

<p>So Phelim Burke, smiling and with the soft Gaelic on
his lips, put out his hand into the air and touched fingers
with life that none other could see.</p>

<p>Presently Crawford looked up, and saw the Irishmen
who had loved Sir Phelim standing around, tears running
down their ragged beards, with Frontin and three Englishmen
beside; the others were dead. “<i>Mhuire as truagh!</i>”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
burst out the Irish voices, but at that wail, Crawford
came stiffly to his feet and cut short the keen cry.</p>

<p>“Phelim na Murtha is at peace—see you not the smile
on his lips? Mourn not. Instead, divide among you what
food is left. Frontin, are all the others dead?”</p>

<p>“All warm now, cap’n. Four of us wounded.” Frontin
showed a rag about his arm where a shaft had torn the
flesh somewhat. “Load the guns, break for the trees—eh?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Crawford curtly. His gaze swept around,
but found only silent trees and bleak white solitude. He
was trapped and helpless. “Dig a grave in the snow—it’s
the best we can do for poor Phelim. Wrap him in
the spare furs.”</p>

<p>“There comes that red devil down the valley, cap’n.”</p>

<p>Crawford looked, and saw the burly figure of Maclish.
Then he saw Maclish stop and fling back his head, and
caught the insolent call.</p>

<p>“Come ye out and talk, Crawford! Bring your black
dog if ye like—there’s guns all trained on ye. No talk
now of putting a knife in me, eh?”</p>

<p>Crawford beckoned to Frontin and walked out toward
where Maclish stood. Desperately, he fought down his
raging anger; he must keep cool at all costs. It would do
no good to strike down this murderous rogue and then die
at the hands of the hidden Stone Men.</p>

<p>“Well, say your word!” exclaimed Maclish, baring his
yellow fangs. “Those young men of mine are impatient.
Do you go back to Albany, or shall we finish you
off?”</p>

<p>“I don’t go back, that’s certain,” said Crawford, eyeing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
him steadily. “All I ask you is to spare those men of
mine. Let them go in peace.”</p>

<p>“So!” Maclish laughed at this. “You’d sooner stay
under the snow, eh? Have it any way ye like, man. I’ll
be going on to find the Star Woman—hey! What deil’s
business is this?”</p>

<p>He swung around, the agile movement betraying that
his brawn was all corded sinew. From the trees, near
and far, were sounding sharp staccato yelps, indicating
the large force of men concealed; then appeared figures
leaping into sight, shouts flinging back and forth. Even
Crawford comprehended that something eventful had occurred.</p>

<p>After a moment two Indians left the trees, starting forward
toward the group. One of them was stumbling,
exhausted, his snowshoes draggling as he walked. The
other was obviously a chief—the chief of the Stone Men
with Maclish. The Scot, who must have comprehended
what the shouting meant, spat an oath and then stood
frowning. Crawford, alert to snatch at whatever might
turn up, waited in silence.</p>

<p>The two redskins came forward across the snow. The
messenger panted out swift words, accompanying them by
pantomime which showed that he had been drawn to this
place by the smoke of Crawford’s fire. That he was not
one of Maclish’s party was fairly evident from his manner.
Maclish heard him out, heard a word from the chief,
then swore fervently and looked at Crawford.</p>

<p>“The deil’s luck! A message for ye, Crawford,” he
said, snarling. “This lad and two others were hunting,
were caught by some Dacotah, and the others were killed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
This lad was sent back with a message, and the chief says
ye must have it.”</p>

<p>“What’s the message?” demanded Crawford. Maclish
eyed him sullenly, but delivered it.</p>

<p>“That two chiefs sent by the Star Woman expect to
meet ye at the Spirit Lake. News of you has gone on,
eh? Now, what d’ye know of it?”</p>

<p>Crawford shook his head in negation. Looking from
the angry Scot to the Assiniboine chief, he swiftly weighed
and sifted the matter, while Frontin muttered behind him.
He saw suddenly that Maclish no longer dared murder
him; this direct message from the Star Woman had disturbed
the Stone Men in most singular fashion—they regarded
it as an interposition at a critical moment. Though
foes of the Dacotah, these Stone Men greatly dreaded the
Star Woman, and would not dare prevent Crawford going
to meet her emissaries. At the same time, Maclish was
not a man to be easily cheated of his prey.</p>

<p>“I’ll trade with you,” said Crawford. “Now listen, ye
redbeard Scots rogue! For the work ye’ve done this day,
I mean to put ye in hell—mark that well! Your Indians
won’t stop me now, for fear o’ the Star Woman. Shall we
make a bargain, or fight it out between us, here and now?”</p>

<p>Maclish was furious, but held his temper back. With a
trade in view, no canny Scot has ever been known to lose
his head.</p>

<p>“What’s the proposition?”</p>

<p>“I’ll go on to the Spirit Lake with you and ten of your
men. We’ll get this message, then settle our own quarrel.
Meantime, my men are to be let go unhindered, back to
the bay. They’re not to be prisoners——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>“Ay.” Maclish fingered his red beard, angrily. “Ay,
we ha’ sore need o’ men at the south posts, after the way
Iberville stripped us. If they’ll take company service,
they’ll be gladly welcomed. H’m! So you and I go on
alone, then?”</p>

<p>“And I,” spoke up Frontin. Maclish darted a glance
at him.</p>

<p>“And who are ye?”</p>

<p>“My friend,” said Crawford. “Take the trade or leave
it. After we get the message from the Star Woman, we’ll
settle our quarrel. I’ll put ye in hell for this day’s work,
mind that!”</p>

<p>Maclish blew on his fingers and pondered. If Crawford
were in a trap, Maclish certainly was in a quandary. The
Scot had laid out a great programme—alliance with the
Star Woman, all the Dacotah and southern trade drawn up
to the bay posts, himself a great man after the manner of
Henry Kelsey, a lord of the north! And now he was
within actual reach of this Star Woman, provided he did
not lose his head. Offend the Stone Men he dared not,
and to kill Crawford now would certainly offend them.</p>

<p>“I’ll do it,” he said. “And to-morrow at the Spirit Lake
I’ll break your bit neck wi’ my two hands! The Assiniboine
chief and nine men go on with us. The others take
your men back safe to the Cree country.”</p>

<p>“Agreed.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll talk it over wi’ this pawky bird of a chief.”</p>

<p>Maclish turned his back, beckoned the chief, and drew
him somewhat to one side out of earshot. Frontin
straightened up, and his hand dropped to his belt. Crawford
checked him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>“No.”</p>

<p>The dark hawk-face swept around. “Eh? With him
dead——”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Crawford looked at Maclish and the chieftain, who
were talking; then the Scot turned and waved his hand.</p>

<p>“All agreed,” he said curtly. “We’ll start in an hour
and reach the lake by noonday to-morrow, or before.”</p>

<p>Crawford and Frontin walked back toward their men.
Presently Crawford smiled bleakly.</p>

<p>“With that man dead,” he said, “who would pay me
for the murder of Phelim Burke?”</p>

<p>Frontin looked a little astonished. “Death of my life!
Do you want to see him at the stake, then?”</p>

<p>Crawford considered this. “After a fashion, yes. I
want him to see himself at the stake.”</p>

<p>“You err in the man, cap’n. I know that type, with
ears so high set! He has no imagination. He is purely
animal.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said Crawford. “Does an animal fear
death? Not at all. An animal, however, invariably possesses
one high quality, and that is pride!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Frontin whistled softly. “Well, perhaps you
are right. All the same, I tell you that this animal is
dangerous.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” said Crawford. “By the way, does it occur
to you that this message reached us just in time? I
begin to think that the Star of Dreams is invincible.”</p>

<p>“H’m!” Frontin scratched his chin. “Nine men back
at Hudson Bay in an English post—now I wonder what’s
brewing in that devil’s brain of yours, my friend?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>“Cortez burnt his ships behind him—I build mine,” said
Crawford. He clapped Frontin on the shoulder. “Well,
the fool has let us live; now let him rue it! We have
work to do, you and I. Let’s lay Phelim Burke away—poor
gallant gentleman who loved his king too well!
Damnation to all kings and to all men who inherit what
they have no power to earn or take!”</p>

<p>“That,” amended Frontin cynically, “is an excellent key
to the Scriptures, applicable to heaven as well as to things
of this world, since one gains no free passage thither. To
those who do not earn, damnation! I have no desire to be
critical, my dear cap’n, but it is a pity that you do not
turn your talents to theology. Heigh-ho! A queer world.”</p>

<p>None the less, as he approached the wrapped body of
Phelim Burke, Frontin crossed himself and his lips moved
a little. There were gentler things inside this dark man—and
crueller things too—than most other men would
guess. When Phelim was laid away under the snow, and
none could think of what to say above him except perhaps
a paternoster and an ave, it was Frontin who spoke a few
soft words which Crawford held long in his memory.</p>

<p>“Seigneur,” said he, looking up at the sky, “where is
Thy guerdon for what hath not been? Receive the soul
of this man, and let the stars sing him welcome, and bid
St. Michael make a place for him beside Thee; it was not
his to seek the grails of pomp and power, for like Thee he
knew how weak is strength, and how truth and justice fare
not with the strong. Welcome him, Seigneur, for his sure
faith in all the things that are not seen; and let the troublesome
winds be hushed for him who was a better man than
we here left behind. <i>Curam teneamus.</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>“Ay,” murmured Crawford. “We’ll remember you,
Phelim—and so shall Maclish!”</p>

<p>So there slept Sir Phelim Burke na Murtha, and the
long ululation of his Irishmen lifted in a doleful wail of
mourning among the trees.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

A KNIFE DOES DIFFERENT THINGS IN DIFFERENT HANDS</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the heart of this northland wilderness, set amid
trees like a green crystal jewel, was a hard-frozen
little lake, solidly rimmed in by heavy evergreens,
its ice blown clear and smooth by the keen winds. To-day
it was calm and deathly still; the very air seemed
heavy, bitter with the doom of men, chilled by the unseen
breath which struck so terribly. In the centre of the lake
thrust up a tiny islet of bare and jagged rock, now blown
partially grey and naked, now cloaked with masses of ice.
About the edge of this islet the first ice of winter had
been flung up to form fantastic ridges and caverns.</p>

<p>This was the Spirit Lake. In this spot, to-day, was
being enacted a singular and frightful drama, the more
terrible because of its uncanny certainty, its mystery, its
silence and absolute precision. The lake and islet were
not sacred to peace, for no spot in this land was untouched
of blood; but the islet, being the abode of spirits, was
shunned by common consent. The red men did not like
the looks of it on general principles.</p>

<p>No canoe furrowed this lake in summer. Around it
for league on league were to be seen neither lodge-poles
of the living nor tree-scaffolds of the dead. To north
and northwest roamed the Stone Men; when they came
down into this country of lakes and streams to seek
game, they encountered the parties of Dacotah upsurging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
from the south. To the east, yet keeping careful distance,
roved the Crees. The Sauteurs or Chippewas also
came up from the south, but these kept out of strife,
standing neutral between Stone Men and Dacotah. While
this islet in the Spirit Lake was a good place for young
warriors to seek medicine and dream dreams, most of
them preferred other quarters for this work.</p>

<p>It was still morning when the heavy green rim of the
icebound lake gave birth to the figure of a man clad in
wool capote and sash, short wide snowshoes slung over
shoulder; he was followed by a second in like guise,
both carrying French fusils. They were Sauteurs, belonging
to a band out on winter hunt. They had no
enemy to fear, yet approached the islet warily. Their
reason for this approach was a faint trail across the
smooth ice, a trail as of sharp caribou hooves which here
and there had slipped or left distinct marks on the glassy
surface.</p>

<p>These two hunters gradually drew closer to the islet,
toward which ran the trail in a direct and undeviating
line; that actual hunger drove them to follow such a
trail was evident in their gaunt and famished aspect.
Their eyes searched the jutting mass of ice and rock
with sharp suspicion and wonder. To all appearance the
islet was empty of life. Now the leading warrior drew
near to the ice-rimmed shore, his brown features wrinkled
by some indefinable perplexity, by a half-sensed
warning. He came to the fantastic line of icy hummocks,
looked down to be sure the caribou trail led into them,
then slowly strode in among their masses. He vanished
instantly. The second warrior stopped short, uttered a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
low word, put hand to fusil. Something flashed red in the
air, a streak of vivid scarlet cutting athwart the blue
sky. The Sauteur clutched at his throat and toppled
over; he lay motionless, dead ere he struck the ice, the
shaft of a crimson arrow protruding from his gullet.</p>

<p>Some little time elapsed. Then, although no sign of
living men appeared, there was a movement at the islet’s
verge—something uncoiled, mounted in the air. Out toward
the prostrate figure shot a thin hide rope, unlooping
and flying with the certainty of a darting snake. Its
noose caught on the upturned foot of the dead man.
The rope drew taut, the body slowly slid in toward the
shore, still tightly gripping the fusil, and there vanished
from sight. All was silent again, motionless, breathless.</p>

<p>Presently, at a point around the lake shore where the
fringe of trees opened out a little, thirteen men appeared.
They doffed snowshoes and made camp, their fire-smoke
rising greyly against the sky. Three of these were white
men, the others Assiniboines or Stone Men; and almost
immediately these latter scattered out to hunt, leaving
Crawford and Frontin alone with Maclish. The three
stood gazing about, scanning the lake, the quiet sky, the
silent trees.</p>

<p>“No sign of ’em,” said the Scot, scratching his pointed
red beard. His whitish eyes probed the shores around,
and the treetops. “Likely they’ll come to us when they
see our smoke. Let’s find some wet wood and make a
good signal.”</p>

<p>The three turned in among the trees.</p>

<p>After a time, at another point around the lake, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
man emerged upon the ice. He, too, was following the
trail of sharp hooves; it was quite singular that such a
trail should have been left, running straight to the little
islet, and so he found it. He was the Assiniboine chief,
and alone. Had he known that there were more than one
of these caribou trails, all converging on the islet, each
made with great cunning to simulate the stagger of a
hurt or wounded beast, he might not have followed on—but
he perceived only the one trail.</p>

<p>All the same, he was uneasy. He stared from ice to
islet, paused now and again to touch a medicine bag
at his throat, examined the open ice around him as a fox
scrutinizes the openings about a bait. He slowly drew
in toward the islet, showing on this side the naked rock
to face the wind-blown north. He was taking no chances,
either on angry spirits or maddened beasts. As he approached
the shore he primed his musket afresh, narrowly
examining the rocks. Little by little he drew
closer, and presently leaped up to the nearest rock. One
instant he stood there peering around, his figure sharply
outlined against the sky—then he was gone, dragged
down by some sinuous, uncoiling thing. A long cry
started up, the death-yell of a chief; it was quenched
midway. After that, the islet was silent again.</p>

<p>For some time the three white men waited about their
built-up fire, which now sent a goodly column of smoke
drifting upward. They were not at ease, however. Frontin
was dark and snarling, Crawford moody and depressed;
this contact with the man who had murdered
Phelim Burke was something hard to endure. Maclish
knew this, and watched them narrowly, and after a bit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
rose. He went to the lake shore and stood gazing out
at the island. The other two exchanged a glance, then
joined him.</p>

<p>“Shall we have a look at it?” asked Frontin. “I’d
like to see the spirits there.”</p>

<p>“Ay, let’s have a look,” grunted Maclish. Crawford
assented silently.</p>

<p>The three men started off across the smooth, glistening
ice. All three were bareheaded, having doffed their
furs, for now the winter chill was out of the air.</p>

<p>If this were gone, there was another sort of chill
which reached them before half the distance to the islet
was covered. Crawford, in the lead, felt it and knew
that the others were also touched by the same perturbation.
Perhaps it came from the tales of the red men,
perhaps from some sixth sense; at all events, that silent
mass of rock and ice imparted a strangely weird and
uncanny impression. The feeling that unseen eyes
watched them was acute. Two-thirds of the way to the
island, Frontin suddenly halted.</p>

<p>“Me, I do not like this,” he exclaimed. “If the trail
were covered, it were better. Prime your gun, cap’n.”</p>

<p>Crawford half turned. His moccasined foot slipped
on the ice, and he fell heavily on hands and knees. Maclish
grunted with swift malice.</p>

<p>“A bad omen for ye.” Then the words died in a gasp
of surprise.</p>

<p>Crawford rose. He fumbled at his breast, where a
splendid thing now glittered. That fall had shaken from
inside his coat the star which he wore there on a thong.
He held it up, examining it to see if the jewel had suffered;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
the raw gold, the massy emeralds, glinted and
glimmered in the afternoon sunlight. Maclish stared in
speechless wonder; it was his first sight of the thing, his
first indication that Crawford bore such a treasure.</p>

<p>Maclish was not the only one to stare. From the islet
ahead rang out a sharp exclamation, and the three men
looked up. They saw a queer creature standing there on
the rocks gazing at them—a tall Indian, over whose head
was flung the skull and robe of a bison, the fur cloaking
his body. At that grotesque and horned apparition all
three gazed, transfixed.</p>

<p>“Come!” To their still greater astonishment, the
crested figure spoke in French. “Smoke the calumet.
Come!”</p>

<p>Crawford could not tell whether this were an invitation
or not, but he comprehended that sight of the star at his
throat had brought the apparition.</p>

<p>“<i>Kola!</i> Friend!” said that singular creature perched
against the blue sky, and flung out empty hands. “The
Star Woman sent us to meet you. Come.”</p>

<p>Then the figure vanished. The islet was bare and
empty again.</p>

<p>“No spirit, but a trap,” said Frontin, first to recover
speech. “There are our messengers—and have a care,
cap’n!”</p>

<p>“Deil take me,” snorted Maclish, “but yon man spoke
French! From the south, belike.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Crawford quietly. “Frontin, wait
here with the muskets. It’s no trap, but we’ll not take
chances.” He passed his musket to Frontin. “Coming
with me, Maclish?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>“Oh, ay.”</p>

<p>Crawford resumed his course, Maclish at his elbow.
Between these two men had passed few words since the
previous day. Hatred lay between them, and fear. Maclish
was a subtle and a canny man, but he could not
fathom the stern silence and self-control of Crawford.
Nor had the latter missed certain indications which
warned him that Maclish was even now carrying on some
treacherous game. The Stone Men had sent up lengthy
smoke-signals which he could not read, and messengers
had departed. It was tacitly understood that after meeting
the Dacotah envoys, the quarrel between the two
men would be settled—Maclish doubtless counting on
murdering both Frontin and Crawford.</p>

<p>Now, gaining the shore ice, Crawford passed in among
the hummocks, gained the rocks beyond, and mounted
them. He heard Maclish coming to his side, and then
jumped down. It was a hideous scene which greeted the
two men, a scene which could not fail to give the impression
intended.</p>

<p>Here was a hollow among the rocks, and in the centre
of it a blackened space of old fires showing that the Dacotah
envoys had been camped here for some little time.
In the centre of this blackened area now blazed a fire
of a few dry sticks—a very tiny fire, without smoke or
heat, serving only to keep the red spark of life in being.
Across from this fire sat in grave silence the man who
had summoned them, his face streaked with white and
vermilion under the horned bison robe; with him was a
second man who wore the head and pelt of a grey timber
wolf in similar fashion. Both of them regarded Crawford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
and Maclish with steady scrutiny—but the two
white men were staring hard at the lifeless things behind
the two Dacotah.</p>

<p>These had been men, all six of them. Two Sauteurs,
three Crees, and the Assiniboine chief of Maclish’s party;
they were dead, sitting in frozen silence as though watching
the council fire, cunningly placed soon after death
so that their rigid bodies assumed the sitting posture
naturally. They had not been scalped. Only the horrible
fixedness of eye and sinew betrayed their condition.
A cry of fury broke from Maclish at sight of the
chieftain.</p>

<p>“I’ll have your scalps for this, ye rogues!”</p>

<p>“My brothers are welcome,” said the bison-chief in
French. “We do not understand the strange talk that is
like the crackling of dried leaves.”</p>

<p>“You’ll understand it soon enough,” retorted Maclish,
in groping and barbarous French, and added an oath.
“You’ve murdered the chief!”</p>

<p>Crawford, inwardly laughing at all this, struck in
smoothly. The fact that these chiefs spoke French,
which was obviously difficult for Maclish, was a godsend.</p>

<p>“This man is an Englishman,” and he gestured toward
Maclish, who was purple with fury. “He is my enemy,
and leads the Stone Men. He seeks the Star Woman,
and so do I. Presently he and I will settle our quarrel.
We await your message.”</p>

<p>“That is good,” said the Dacotah. “Standing Bull and
Yellow Sky have brought belts from the Star Woman.
We are of the nation of The Men, the Issanti clan of the
Dacotah. The Star Woman ordered us to meet in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
fashion the white man who came to seek her, and to give
him the belts. We have waited long. Now we do not
understand who is to receive these belts. It was said
that the white man was an Englishman, having red hair.”</p>

<p>At these words Crawford started slightly. It was true
that his hair was a reddish brown.</p>

<p>Maclish did not comprehend all that was said, between
his poor command of French and his overpowering rage.
Crawford, however, made a swift and shrewd guess that
the message from the Star Woman was not a nice one;
remembering the token she had sent Moses Deakin, he
resolved to gamble heavily on this presumed fact. Now,
as Standing Bull produced a calumet and a bag of willow-bark,
Maclish spat hot words at him.</p>

<p>“I will not smoke with you! Am I to smoke with you
while the eyes of that dead chief reproach me?”</p>

<p>“The calumet has not been offered you,” was the calm
response. “We do not smoke with Englishmen, who are
enemies of our brothers the French. Which of you is to
receive the belts?”</p>

<p>Crawford intervened with precision.</p>

<p>“This man Red Bull seeks to marry the Star Woman
and to carry her off among the Stone Men. It is to him
that your belts are sent. I am an Irishman. With me
is my friend, who is a Frenchman. I will call him.”</p>

<p>This drew an approving grunt of surprise and pleasure.
“<i>Was-te! Was-te!</i>” The burly Scot, with the game
thus taken out of his hands, scowled. Crawford touched
his arm.</p>

<p>“Watch yourself, Maclish! There may be other Dacotah
stationed among the rocks, so go slowly. Their message<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
seems to be for you.” He lifted his voice and called.
“Ho, Frontin! Leave the guns and come along.”</p>

<p>“You will see that I speak truly,” he said to the two
chiefs. “My medicine has sent me to meet you, that you
may take me with you to seek the Star Woman. I shall
go with you, and her heart will be glad. Look, here is
my medicine!”</p>

<p>He laid bare the star of gold and emeralds, and at
closer sight of this Star of Dreams, astonishment seized
the two red men. Obviously, they had heard that the
man seeking the Star Woman carried this jewel; they
were visibly shaken by sight of it, knowing not what to
say or do. Its effect upon them was profound, and it also
plunged them into perplexity.</p>

<p>Now Frontin came scrambling over the rocks, and
their eyes shifted to him. When he spoke in French,
they grunted in recognition.</p>

<p>“Death of my life!” said he coolly, looking at the dead
men. “This is a pretty scene!”</p>

<p>“Join me and smoke.” Crawford seated himself opposite
the Dacotah. The younger of these leaned forward
and pointed at the star.</p>

<p>“What is the name of this medicine? Why does not
the Red Bull wear it?”</p>

<p>Crawford laughed slightly and evaded. “It is the Star
of Dreams, and it came to me from afar, in order to lead
me to the Star Woman.”</p>

<p>There was in his voice a certain surety which was impressive—for
he himself had now come to believe in this
jewel. This sincerity made itself felt as no mere words
would have done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>Yet the gamble was a stiff one; and had not Maclish
been so fumbling with his French, the affair might have
gone otherwise, for the Scot was nobody’s fool. He,
however, comprehending that the message had somehow
been turned to him, mastered his anger and once more became
the coolly dangerous rascal. Seating himself, he
growled that he would accept the belts which had been
sent.</p>

<p>Crawford now waited to see whether the calumet
would be offered him. He was confident that this acquiescence
from Maclish had settled the matter of the
message, but he depended on the two Dacotah to get
him and Frontin safely away, as he had implied to them.
Sight of the Star of Dreams had confused the whole
issue for the two chieftains.</p>

<p>They were in no haste, those redskins; this affair was
so extraordinary that they were somewhat at a loss.
Finally Standing Bull got the pipe stuffed, and held a
brand to it. When the pipe was lighted, he puffed ceremoniously
to the winds, the sun and the earth. His companion
did likewise—and the pipe was then handed to
Crawford.</p>

<p>So far, the game was won.</p>

<p>While Frontin smoked in turn, then handed the pipe
back, Maclish sat waiting, intent and narrow-eyed, fully
aware by this time of his own impotence. The pipe was
refused him, and he knew what this meant. It was
doubtful if the Stone Men were yet aware that the three
whites had gone to the islet. Maclish would be in sharp
jeopardy unless he were careful, so the burly Scot bottled
up his anger and settled down to play his game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>Laying aside the pipe, Standing Bull now came to his
feet. He put a hand beneath his robe and produced a
belt of ordinary porcelain trade-beads, which he dropped
at the feet of Maclish.</p>

<p>“This belt,” he began, “says that the Star Woman has
heard of your search for her. It says that her manitou
does not love Englishmen, who are allies of the
Iroquois and enemies of our father Onontio at Montreal.”</p>

<p>Standing Bull produced a second belt of the same material,
turned to the circle of dead men, and laid that belt
across the knees of the Assiniboine chieftain, whom he
addressed.</p>

<p>“This second belt is for the Stone Men; let their eyes
look upon it, let their ears be opened to it! It says that
their manitou is bad, and therefore the Star Woman has
punished them. It says that they have done wrong to
befriend the English, for the Dacotah people have a
French father.”</p>

<p>Now, turning back to Maclish, Standing Bull produced
a third belt—not of white porcelain this time, but a
flaming crimson belt of valuable wampum shells, which
he dropped before the Scot.</p>

<p>“This third belt is for you, Red Bull. It says: ‘You
cannot go farther; the trail is closed against you. The
Star Woman knows your people for bad men and does
not desire to look upon your face. Go back. If you come
farther your scalp will be dried in the lodges of The Men,
your skin will be stretched on the bark wall of the council
house; your <i>manzakawan</i>, your iron tube in which
dwells a spirit, will sit in the lodge of the Star Woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
above the lake of many stars, and will spit no more bullets.’
I have spoken.”</p>

<p>Standing Bull seated himself and drew his robe about
his knees.</p>

<p>For a long moment, Maclish was absolutely beyond
words with torrential fury. He saw now that he had
been tricked into receiving these belts, which had been
meant for Crawford. More, the Dacotah were openly
hostile to him and friendly to Crawford, while he himself
was trapped and helpless on this islet. A slight stir
among the rocks betokened that at least one other redskin
lay hidden. His red features whitened and became
almost livid, then crimsoned again. His breath came
hoarsely. Yet he tried to master himself, his big
bearded jaw jutting forth, his hands clenched until the
knuckles showed white. The effort succeeded.</p>

<p>He moved, stirred his broad bulk, opened his wool coat
and flung it off. One hand went out to the red wampum
belt and drew it in; the other went to his belt and produced
a long knife. With a swift motion he drove the
knife through the centre of the wampum belt, which he
twisted about the haft; he flung belt and knife at the
feet of Standing Bull.</p>

<p>“There is my answer to the Star Woman,” he said,
and with an angry laugh rose to his feet. “So her lodge
is pitched at the lake of many stars? Good. I shall
come and take her as my squaw. The Stone Men shall
dance with your scalps and put you into the kettle, taking
your women as slaves. That is my response. As for this
rascal,” and he whirled on Crawford with a baleful glare,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
“stand up and fight, ye vagabond rogue! Settle our affairs,
as ye said, and I’ll crop your ears for ye.”</p>

<p>Crawford rose, his face very bleak and hard.</p>

<p>“Fight? Who said fight?” he demanded, giving Maclish
a cool stare. “I’ve no intention of fighting with you.
I said we’d settle our business—ay! But we’ll not fight.”</p>

<p>The Scot stared at him, amazed, jaw fallen in sheer
astonishment.</p>

<p>“Eh, man? But——”</p>

<p>Swift as light, his careless attitude giving no warning
of his intention, Crawford swung on his heel and drove
his fist into the pit of the big man’s stomach. It was a
terrific blow, with body weight behind it. Caught all
astare and unsuspecting, Maclish grunted as the breath
was smashed out of him. An expression of mute agony
swept into his face, and he slowly toppled forward, gasping
and senseless.</p>

<p>“<i>Was-te!</i>” came the guttural approval of the two
chiefs. Crawford, standing above the unconscious Maclish,
looked at them for a moment.</p>

<p>“The star fights for me. Will you take us with you
or not?”</p>

<p>“Our brother Wandering Star shall go with us, and his
friend.”</p>

<p>“This is a red bull who never gives up,” and Crawford
stirred the senseless Maclish with his toe. “He will lead
the Stone Men after us.”</p>

<p>“Let my brother drink his blood,” said Standing Bull.</p>

<p>“The time for that has not come. Later on I shall kill
him, but first I shall put my mark upon him, so that all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
men may know that he belongs to me. If he does follow
us, the Dacotah will capture him, then I shall take
him and kill him.”</p>

<p>Crawford did not scrutinize the brown faces as he said
this, or he might have noted that the chiefs showed no
great delight in his prediction. He took out his knife
and stooped over Maclish. With deliberation, he slit the
skin on that sweating, agonized forehead; when he had
finished, the Scot was branded with a five-pointed star.
It bled copiously.</p>

<p>“He has lived well, the bleeding will give him strength,”
said Frontin cynically. “You mistake, cap’n, not to put
the knife into his heart. He promised to crop your ears.”</p>

<p>“Let him live with this brand on him,” said Crawford.
“I shall find him again.”</p>

<p>Frontin shrugged. The two red men rose and bestirred
themselves. From among the rocks came a third warrior,
bearing a pack of dried meat. When the three had
obtained snowshoes and warbags, they took the short
forest snowshoes belonging to the two dead Sauteurs, and
gave these to their white companions. Frontin retrieved
the muskets he had left at the shore.</p>

<p>“Come, my brothers!” said Standing Bull. “Even if
they see us go, the Stone Men will not follow us—until
after they have found their chief.”</p>

<p>Crawford followed them to the edge of the islet, on
the side farthest from the camp of the Stone Men.
There, as all five came to the open ice, with the islet to
cover them from sight of Maclish’s men, Frontin suddenly
halted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>“I’ll be along in a moment, don’t wait,” he said, then
darted back and vanished among the rocks.</p>

<p>The others went on. They were half-way across the
open ice to the shore, when Crawford saw Frontin running
and sliding after them. He was wiping his knife as
he came, and Crawford turned upon him with an angry
look. Frontin laughed and made answer to the tacit
question.</p>

<p>“No, my cap’n! I did no more than crop the rogue’s
ears,” and with this he flung two small objects on the
ice. “I, too, loved Phelim Burke a little.”</p>

<p>There were strange things beneath the shell of this
dark Frontin.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

TWO TRAILS MAY HAVE THE SAME END</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the following week, Crawford’s knowledge
of the Star Woman remained exactly where
it had been. The Dacotah refused to talk, being
troubled and uneasy in spirit. All five men were in fast
and furious flight, acute peril pricking them on; although
they had left the Spirit Lake safely, the Stone Men were
hard on their heels. That Maclish had tricked them all,
was fully appreciated.</p>

<p>The Dacotah envoys were not happy in the event;
perhaps, under the leaden skies, they suspected that their
belts had been delivered amiss. With the passing days,
they began to regret some things and to ponder others.
Storm had been gathering for days. The last of winter
was in the air; the moon of the carp passed into that
of the crane, the snow-crust was disintegrating underfoot,
and the black tempest might be of either snow or
rain. The Dacotah were praying for this storm to burst
and save them, yet it held off—and they now considered
their peril as a punishment for bringing Crawford with
them.</p>

<p>It was not until after this week of hard marching that
they took counsel with Crawford and Frontin. Both
these latter were thoroughly alive to the situation. The
sudden changes of direction, the spurts of speed, the
stratagems, all showed that the Dacotah were desperately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
striving to fling off the encircling enemy whose signal
smokes rose now and again into the leaden sky. Hampered
by their slower companions, the efforts of the Dacotah
were futile.</p>

<p>When Standing Bull broke his silence, it was at the
evening camp after a stiff day of marching. Overhead
was lowering storm, with pines and cedars all amoan in
the darkness. Crawford had lost all sense of direction,
had not glimpsed a soul outside their own party, and had
no idea of his whereabouts; but about noon he had seen
two signal smokes to their right, and was not blind to the
angry nervousness of the red men. And Standing Bull,
having come to the point of speech, delivered a word that
was blunt enough.</p>

<p>“Let my brothers open their ears,” he said abruptly.
“We have helped them; without our aid the Stone Men
would have danced their scalps. We have done as we
promised. If Wandering Star had killed the Red Bull,
the Stone Men would not now be on our trail.”</p>

<p>Crawford shrugged. Standing Bull gravely continued.</p>

<p>“Among the hills at the sacred lake of many stars,
lives the Star Woman. She has spent the winter there
with five lodges of my young men, who seek medicine before
being admitted to the brotherhoods. Here is the
lake,” and to represent it, he drew a circle in the snow.
“That lies half a moon’s journey from this place.” To
indicate their present position, he drew a cross, orientating
the diagram. “The Spirit Lake, where my brothers
came to meet us, lies here.” He completed his map
with a black cinder, which formed a rude triangle with
the other points.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>This mute witness in the snow spoke eloquently
enough. Crawford saw that instead of heading straight
from the Spirit Lake to the Star Woman, they had come
far to the south. The reason for this circumlocution
was now shown by a flint which the chief took from his
French firebag and laid down—the flint standing for the
Assiniboines or Stone Men, who had driven the party
well off their direct course.</p>

<p>“Death of my life, but he should be royal cartographer!”
exclaimed Frontin admiringly. “I thought that
accursed Maclish was a tricky rogue. When he agreed
to take us to the Spirit Lake with ten men, the sly fox
tricked us—he brought down the whole pack of Assiniboines
on our heels!”</p>

<p>Crawford nodded, and caught an assenting gleam in
the eyes of the chief. Standing Bull resumed his exposition
of affairs, and swept a brown finger in the snow,
well to the southward.</p>

<p>“Here is the country of The Men. The Spirit Woman
lives far from us; she is a friend of all people, and many
tribes send to her for healing or counsel. I have spent
the winter in her lodge with my young men, hunting for
her needs and trapping castor for the French posts. Now
I must go to her swiftly with Old Bear, here,” and he
indicated the third Dacotah, who was a young man despite
his name. “The trail must now be forked in three
ways. I go ahead with Old Bear, because my brothers
cannot travel fast. Here to the south must go Yellow
Sky, seeking the villages of my people, to bring a war-party
against the Stone Men.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>“Oh!” Crawford perceived that he and Frontin were
abandoned. “And what about us?”</p>

<p>Standing Bull touched Crawford’s shirt, beneath which
hung the Star of Dreams.</p>

<p>“My brother’s manitou is strong. It will protect him.”</p>

<p>Crawford’s lips twitched ironically. Frontin broke
into a gay laugh of mirth.</p>

<p>“Well touched, cap’n! Those buccaneers of Joppa
said the same thing when they pitched Jonah overboard,
eh? Well, they were right; and I am not so sure but that
the chief here is also right!”</p>

<p>Crawford ignored this comment, and also disdained
to argue with the Dacotah. These, obviously, were determined
to abandon the white men and flee. Since one
was heading south to raise a war-party, the danger must
be pressing indeed. Their resolve angered him, yet he
was helpless before it.</p>

<p>“Very well, I’ll trust to the star,” he said. “How shall
we find this lake of many stars, since we do not know
this country at all? According to this diagram, it lies
northwest of us; but there are no trails in the wilderness.”</p>

<p>“Your medicine is very strong, it will whisper in your
ear,” said the chief sententiously. “It will confuse the
Stone Men and throw them off your trail. It will guide
you——”</p>

<p>Crawford lost his temper at this.</p>

<p>“You are not warriors, but women; may the foul fiend
fly away with you! Go, and the sooner the better.”</p>

<p>Somewhat to his consternation, Standing Bull and the
other two redskins instantly took him at his word; they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
were very close to panic. The three caught up their
packs, pulled their snowshoes from the snow, and in two
minutes had melted away into the darkness.</p>

<p>Frontin, slow to comprehend that the Dacotah were
actually departing, stared after them, then burst into a
storm of bitter oaths.</p>

<p>“Why, the scurvy rogues mean to follow along the ice
of that little river below us—leaving the enemy to swoop
down on our trail in the snow! Unless we go the same
way.”</p>

<p>Crawford nodded. The Dacotah, frightened, were
leaving the whites as a scalp-gift to the Stone Men; the
danger, then, was imminent. He stared with sombre
eyes over his pipe into the tiny fire-glow, then began to
study that diagram in the snow.</p>

<p>“At least, they got us away from Maclish and his men,”
he said. “See, now! We must strike to the northwest
until we reach hills; that’s clear enough. This frozen
river below us comes from the northwest or runs that
way—sink me if I can tell which. We must take to
the ice.”</p>

<p>“And trail the Dacotah?”</p>

<p>“No; they’ll cover their trail. Undoubtedly Maclish
tricked us smoothly. When Standing Bull laid that belt
over the knees of the dead Assiniboine chief, he declared
war. Crafty Maclish will make the most of that, be
sure! If he can persuade them to capture the Star
Woman and bring the Dacotah to terms, he may yet
win his game and be a second Kelsey. Well, I wish we
were out of this accursed ice and snow! Winter lasts
forever in this land.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>“We’ll be out of it when the storm breaks——”</p>

<p>“Unless the storm brings snow. Sly fellows, those Dacotahs!
If snow comes, their tracks are covered, while
we are lost. Suppose we dine.”</p>

<p>The decamping redskins had left a fair share of dried
meat, with two rabbits which hung over the fire. Crawford
and Frontin quieted their hunger, then lighted pipes
and smoked in silence. Crawford fully realized the difficulty
of finding the Star Woman in this wilderness; the
very thought was oppressive, hopeless. A fortnight of
snow-travel was not only vague, but implied great distances.</p>

<p>“I made a mistake,” he said, and at this admission
Frontin shot him a look. “When I left Maclish alive, I
took for granted that the Star Woman lived among the
Dacotah, or close to them. So, as Maclish was bound to
follow us, the future looked safe. As it now turns out,
nothing is certain. Well, no matter! Have you any idea
of what the month might be? I’ve quite lost track.”</p>

<p>Frontin held a brand to his pipe. Then he held his
hand up in air and waited a moment.</p>

<p>“The month is April,” he said, so positively that Crawford
regarded him in surprise.</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“A snowflake came down on my hand, and was rain
before it more than touched the skin.”</p>

<p>A slight hiss from the embers emphasized the words,
and Crawford straightened up. The storm was indeed
close at hand. From the dark forest was coming a queer
stir and rustle, then Crawford felt the touch of snow on
his cheek. He leaped to his feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>“Quick—our chance! If those rascals had only
waited! In another hour it will be raining. Get our stuff
together; we must travel along the ice until we can’t
lift a foot! If we go fast and far enough, the trail will
be covered.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Frontin. “I have just recollected something
important.”</p>

<p>“What, then?” said Crawford impatiently.</p>

<p>“When Standing Bull delivered that belt to Maclish,
he stated where the Star Woman lived—and the red
Scot caught the words.”</p>

<p>“What of it?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.” Frontin rose, shrugged, and smiled thinly.
“These stiff moccasins! But better stiff shoes than stiff
toes. Ready—belay all! I’d give a year of life to be
on the ocean again.”</p>

<p>The two men started into the darkness, feeling their
way by the broken trail which the Dacotah had left. Ten
minutes later they had gained the open sweep of the
river below, while slushy rain pelted them and the storm
burst with a rush and a wild howl.</p>

<p>Until past midnight they pushed on, following the
river-ice; then, too spent to crawl another rod and
soaked to the skin, they curled up beneath a dripping
spruce and slept in utter exhaustion until the grey dawn
broke. Once more forward, along the trail of the river
under driving squalls of cold rain, until by afternoon
they were forced to leave this easy road. The heavy
rainfall, combined with sluices of melted snow from the
hillsides, formed a knee-deep stream above the ice and
sent them staggering through slushy snow toward higher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
ground. There, amid a thick copse of trees, they dared
to kindle a fire with the rusty heart of a dead birch and
some dry wood from beneath an old stump; and made a
shelter of boughs.</p>

<p>Here for two days they remained, miserable and half
starved, having lost part of their meagre supplies. Further
progress was impossible; the storm continued with
unabated fury, pouring down wet snow or flooding all
things with blinding rain. Every ravine was a foaming
torrent, the lower ground was a vast morass; muskegs
had become lakes, and the higher ground was still sticky
with half-melted drifts of snow. A six-month of winter
does not vanish in three days of rain. Their sole consolation
was that the trail was swept away, and the enemy
could be in no better situation. No sign of human life
was visible. Finally, on the fourth morning the skies
had emptied themselves, the sun came out strong and
glorious, and the soaked forest began to steam. With
their last food gone, the two men broke camp and set
forth.</p>

<p>All that morning they pushed steadily toward the
northwest, following a long rolling ridge which walled
the valley. Sharply as they scanned sky and horizon,
closely as they searched the green-banked treecrests and
the farther slopes, they could detect no indication of life,
no greyish trickle of ascending smoke. Yet it was unthinkable
that Maclish would give up his pursuit.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon Crawford, desperate for food
and confident that the enemy were left far behind,
knocked over a rabbit with his musket, the shot sending
mighty echoes from the trees. Half an hour later the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
men built a cautious fire and made shift to cook the rabbit
in the heart of a fir-thicket. Hunger partially appeased,
they lighted pipes and rested while their outer
moccasins, moss-stuffed, dried by the fire-embers. Over
his pipe Frontin evinced a growing uneasiness, and at
last growled out an oath.</p>

<p>“I think the loneliness of this accursed wilderness has
crept into my brain. I have the feeling that eyes are
watching us.”</p>

<p>Crawford flung him a sharp look. “Any reason for
it?”</p>

<p>“None.”</p>

<p>“We’ve scouted well, and the woods are open enough.
If we were in Mohawk land,” added Crawford thoughtfully,
“it would be different; but these northern Indians
are not Iroquois, and don’t know how to work in Iroquois
fashion.”</p>

<p>“But they are no fools, as we know to our cost.” Frontin
swept the trees around with his fierce hawk-like gaze.
At this instant Crawford caught the distinct “click” of
a fusil brought to cock; and from close at hand a voice
addressed them in French.</p>

<p>“Have my brothers never heard who taught the dogs
of Iroquois how to hunt? Let them look through the
forest. Perhaps they will see the chief of the Wolf nation.”</p>

<p>Both men leaped to their feet. They stood gazing
about, searching the trees yet finding nothing. Save for
the shadowed leaf-play of the evergreens, nothing moved
in the sunshine. A low laugh sounded; then, not twenty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
feet distant, appeared the tall figure of an Indian who
stood carefully uncocking his fusil. For a moment he
regarded them in amusement, keenly gratified by their
puzzled alarm, then advanced toward them. He was an
old, gaunt, erect redskin of great dignity. He was unpainted,
naked to the waist save for crossed baldricks
which carried firebag, bullets and horn. His head was
shaven to a grizzled scalplock.</p>

<p>“My brothers are Frenchmen; that is good,” he said
gravely. “My father Metaminens, who is ill, heard the
sound of a gun. He sent Le Talon, a war-chief of the
Wolf nation, to see who fired that gun. Come! Metaminens
will smoke with you, if he is awake.”</p>

<p>Crawford was pardonably astonished. He knew that
the Loups, whom the English called Mohegans, were an
almost extinct tribe, divided in allegiance between Iroquois
and French. What any of them were doing in this
country was problematical; also, this Le Talon conveyed
in his manner an extraordinary impression. He was no
common warrior.</p>

<p>“He wears a crucifix at his girdle,” commented Frontin.
“You’ll go?”</p>

<p>“Of course.” Crawford addressed the Mohegan chief.
“Has Le Talon seen anything of other men near by?”
A shake of the head made answer, and Crawford continued.
“We are pursued by the Stone Men. The storm
has thrown them off, but if they pick up our trail, it will
mean danger to you and your father Metaminens.”</p>

<p>The wrinkled brown face of the old warrior flashed in
a quick, scornful laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>“One who has taken many Iroquois scalps does not
fear wandering dogs of the west. Our camp is not a mile
from here. Do you come?”</p>

<p>Crawford nodded, and signed for the chief to lead the
way. As he and Frontin fell in behind, he flung a quick
word at his friend.</p>

<p>“All these Mohegans are wandering devils, loving intrigue
and war above aught else, and we can’t afford to
pass by the chance. They may know this country, or
may be glad to come with us. Besides, there is an air of
mystery about this chief.”</p>

<p>“And who has more curiosity than a woman—unless
it be a man?” said Frontin ironically.</p>

<p>Crawford soon found himself hard taxed to keep the
pace set by the old Mohegan chief, who glided among the
trees like a shadow, making no more sound than a shadow,
and whose flitting figure had all the mottled impermanence
of a shadow as it passed from opening to opening.
These Mohegans were beyond question friends; probably
hunters or traders who had wandered up from the French
posts on Lake Superior or the Mississippi.</p>

<p>When it came to fighting or trailing, two of them
would be worth more than a score of Crees.</p>

<p>Presently the old chieftain lifted his head and flung
up a sharp wolf-howl.</p>

<p>“That is my brother Chaudière Noire,” he grunted, as
a response came from farther ahead. “Black Kettle
waits at the fire of our father Metaminens.”</p>

<p>Three Mohegans, then! So much the better, thought
Crawford, knowing what grim warriors were these men
whom even the Mohawks deemed worthy of adoption and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
alliance. Their very presence in this wilderness was
proof of their worth.</p>

<p>Presently they came to a rivulet which ran thigh-deep
with icy water. Plunging through this torrent of melted
snow, Le Talon came to an abrupt halt on the farther
brink. From the bushes above him emerged a figure,
stripped to the waist, scalplock greased, face painted;
this was Black Kettle, a younger man than his companion.
He spoke briefly to Le Talon.</p>

<p>“The sickness is on Metaminens. He sleeps. Be careful
not to waken him.”</p>

<p>Crawford made a sign of assent, then followed Black
Kettle and Le Talon into a marshy thicket of spruce
saplings, where the muskeg quivered like jelly underfoot.
In the midst of this thicket, perfectly screened
from all discovery, was a brush shelter covering a
blanketed figure. Caribou meat hung drying over a
small fire. Packs of goods were near by.</p>

<p>All four halted to gaze at the sick man. Crawford
stepped forward—then repressed an exclamation of
amazement. This man, whom the Mohegans in their
own fashion of speech had termed “father,” was a white
man! Now, in the midst of his amazement, Crawford
caught a mutter of feverish delirium from the invalid,
and turned. He drew Le Talon to one side and spoke
quietly, swiftly, Frontin joining them.</p>

<p>“What does this mean? Who is this man?”</p>

<p>“He is Metaminens,” was the surprised response. “In
the great lodge of Onontio at Montreal he is called Sieur
Nicholas Perrot, but throughout the frontier he is Metaminens—Little
Indian Corn—the bringer of peace whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
canoe is always filled with ransomed captives. Who are
you, that you have not heard this name?”</p>

<p>“I have heard it,” said Crawford, and dark Frontin
whistled softly.</p>

<p>Heard it, indeed! Who had not heard that name, so
blackly cursed by the English, so adoringly reverenced
by voyageur and engagé of the French! And here, delirious
and helpless, beyond aid or comfort, lay the explorer
and first opener of the west, the man who had
saved to Canada all her western empire—the famous
Nicholas Perrot.</p>

<p>“We must get him out of here at once,” said Crawford
decisively. “In this marsh he will die, for fever is on
him. Give us some food and we will talk.”</p>

<p>They were soon wolfing some of the caribou meat.
Crawford had already made up his mind what course to
take, for it was impossible to abandon Sieur Perrot. So
the four men squatted at one side of the little opening
among the trees, and Crawford talked.</p>

<p>He told the Mohegans how he had come hither and
what he sought, showed them the star at his throat, spoke
briefly as possible—for the afternoon was fast drawing
on. He was startled by the utter stupefaction of the two
redskins at his words; sight of the Star of Dreams brought
a wondering awe into their eyes. They were far too courteous
to interrupt him, however, and sat in grave silence
while he told them the present situation; none the less, a
certain blaze of excitement was in their eyes.</p>

<p>“We must take instant decision,” he concluded. “Sieur
Perrot is in grave danger here, both from fever and from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
the Stone Men. Are other men with you? Is any post
near by?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Le Talon. “We are in strange country.
We came from Montreal, with Metaminens.”</p>

<p>“Last summer?”</p>

<p>“No. We came by canoe to the Nottawasaga, for the
streams were open. Here in the north they were closed,
and we came on by the ice to this spot.”</p>

<p>Crawford stared at them. “A journey before the rivers
were open—why, it was madness! What caused your
trip? What is Sieur Perrot doing in this country?”</p>

<p>The two Mohegans glanced at each other, exchanged a
nod, and Le Talon continued. In the brown faces was a
quiet excitement, an air of keen suspense.</p>

<p>“Long years ago, before my father Metaminens carried
a grey scalplock, he met a woman in the lodges of the
Dacotah. In those days Metaminens was Commandant
of the West, and ruled for Onontio. Also, he was a chief
among the Dacotah; he was the first white man to visit
them and bring them trade. Now Metaminens is old,
and his scalplock is grey. His manitou has whispered
to him that he must seek this woman again. We, his
children, came with him. That is all.”</p>

<p>Crawford frowned, guessing that the chief was leading
up to some surprise.</p>

<p>“A woman? But the lodges of the Dacotah are not in
this direction!”</p>

<p>“Metaminens seeks the Star Woman,” said Le Talon
bluntly.</p>

<p>A sardonic smile touched the lips of Frontin. Crawford,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
after a slight start of surprise, regarded the Mohegans;
in their intent gaze he read a vivid eagerness, a
breathless suspense—for they were waiting to see how
this tale would affect him.</p>

<p>That they told the truth was indubitable. He could not
question the fact, incredible as it seemed—Perrot, like
himself, had come seeking this Star Woman! More, it
appeared that Sieur Perrot had actually known her in
days past. Well, that was possible enough; he knew that
this explorer had been the one to tell Iberville about the
Star Woman. And at this, a sudden wonder seized upon
him.</p>

<p>“Metaminens told about this Star Woman to Pierre le
Moyne d’Iberville,” he said slowly. “And Iberville told
me—hence I am here. A strange business, a strange business!”</p>

<p>The Indians stared at him in awe, knowing well the
name of Iberville and the man himself; but Frontin
laughed softly, thinly.</p>

<p>“Strange? Not at all, cap’n! <i>Mort de ma vie</i>, we are
going to have some interesting times ahead, you and I
and Perrot—and Maclish!”</p>

<p>Crawford frowned darkly.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

HE WHO DENIES THE INCREDIBLE DENIES GOD</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the silence that followed spoke up Black Kettle, who
was less restrained than the elder chief.</p>

<p>“If the Star Woman knew that Metaminens came
to seek her, then her heart would be glad. She would
send her spirit to make him well. She would send her
young men to meet him.”</p>

<p>At this hint, Crawford woke up. Why not, indeed?
He seized the opening and asserted himself, for that was
Hal Crawford’s way. His orders were decisive, and were
entirely unquestioned, for the Mohegans were accustomed
to the guidance of a white man.</p>

<p>“Good. Two of us must remain here to move camp
and tend Sieur Perrot; that will be perilous enough. The
other two must travel to the Star Woman and send back
her young men to help, and this will be equally dangerous.
Settle between yourselves which is to go. Frontin,
you understand the affair? Clip two sticks and arrange
it. Long stick goes, short stays here. There must be no
delay.”</p>

<p>Frontin comprehended perfectly. There was no question
of abandoning the helpless Perrot, the Mohegans
were invaluable allies, and a separation was inevitable.
Either of them, with one of the Mohegans, could reach
the Star Woman in half the time it would otherwise take
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>Frontin whipped out his knife, clipped two twigs, and
prepared them. He enclosed them in his hand with the
ends showing even, and held them out. Crawford leaned
forward and drew one. Frontin opened his hand and
showed the other—and both were of equal length. At
this, the two Mohegans laughed softly.</p>

<p>“All right, old friend,” said Crawford. “I choose to
stay.”</p>

<p>Frontin leaped up. “Which of you goes with me,
Loups?”</p>

<p>“I go.” Le Talon rose. “My brother Black Kettle has
hurt his foot. Come!”</p>

<p>The two shook their powder-horns, examined firebags,
divided meat and bullets. In five minutes they were
ready.</p>

<p>“Take care of the star, cap’n,” said Frontin. Then he
added, in his assumed cynicism, “<i>Ora pro nobis!</i>”</p>

<p>The next moment, with a wave of his hand, he vanished
among the trees in the wake of Le Talon. The two were
gone.</p>

<p>Crawford and Black Kettle fell hastily to work, since
there was much to be done ere nightfall. Perrot, fast
bound in fever, was tossing and moaning. After locating
a sheltered and hidden spot on a hillside, they carried
him to it; there was a bed of pine boughs to be laid, a
shelter to be constructed, precious dry wood to be uncovered
and collected. The packs had to be moved and the
fire-embers transferred. In all this Black Kettle was at a
disadvantage, for he had twisted his ankle badly and walking
was painful.</p>

<p>Crawford resigned himself to this delay, the more easily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
because of the singular coincidence which had brought
him and Perrot together. Or was it coincidence? He had
come from the northeast, Perrot from the southeast,
roughly aiming at a mutual point; why, then, should they
not have met before reaching that point? It was natural
enough.</p>

<p>During two full days he devoted himself to caring for
the sick man. Black Kettle scouted and reported no sign
of any foe in forest or on horizon. During these two
days, Crawford pondered the reason for Perrot’s presence
here. The Mohegan explanation, that his manitou had
impelled the action, was absolutely accurate; but Crawford
was slow to accept it. Sieur Perrot was an example
of the ingratitude of princes, since he occupied no position
in Canada. He had no official reason to be here,
then.</p>

<p>These thirty years, Nicholas Perrot had sowed where
other men had reaped. No other Frenchman had his influence
among the western tribes. His very name of Little
Indian Corn spoke of the godhead with which the
Green Bay tribes had endowed this first white man to
come among them. Since 1665 he had blazed the trails
where others walked to wealth and fame. To the red
men, he was always known as the sun-bringer. Where
others fanned hot sparks of wrath, Perrot had made peace,
composed quarrels, kept the tribes in alliance to Onontio.
And now he sought the Star Woman—why? In the end,
Crawford renewed this question to Black Kettle, and received
a story whose implications left him thoughtful.</p>

<p>“My brother, I will tell you what I know,” said the
Mohegan gravely. “It is now more than thirty winters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
since my father Metaminens went among the Iowa and
the Dacotah nations. There he met this Star Woman,
who saved his life. What passed between them, I do not
know. My father Metaminens saw her only once or
twice, yet he has often spoken of her. My brother, there
are two roads open to every man, of which the one ends
always, soon or late, at the grave; but Metaminens has
never followed that road. Does my brother understand?”</p>

<p>Crawford nodded. He was startled by the unexpected
depth of thought in this redskin, by the dignified significance
of these last words. Black Kettle continued.</p>

<p>“Always the Star Woman has sent her manitou to watch
over Metaminens. Perhaps he met her again in the west,
when he was Commandant; I do not know. He has often
told of how her spirit saved him from danger, how her influence
was exerted to help him in time of trouble, how
her power among the western tribes aided him. No other
white man has seen the Star Woman. This is all I know.”</p>

<p>Was this some old romance, then? Crawford frowned
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Do you know what this Star Woman looks like?”</p>

<p>“She has hair of gold, and blue eyes, and wears a great
star of blue stones.”</p>

<p>An exclamation of astonishment burst from Crawford.
Thus had Moses Deakin described his vision in the witch-fluid!
Yet it was impossible that he should have seen
her thus, exactly as Perrot had seen her thirty years ago.
No, undoubtedly he had heard Perrot’s description of her—this
would account for the seeming wonder.</p>

<p>Crawford slept upon the matter, and in the morning
found himself still perplexed. He looked at Perrot, found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
the latter sleeping easily and naturally. Black Kettle
had been gone for an hour or more, seeking fresh meat,
and Crawford now stole away to get a new stock of wood,
which had to be chosen carefully if the fire were to be
smokeless.</p>

<p>In half an hour he returned with his burden. He
dropped this by the fire, straightened up—and found
Perrot on one elbow, staring at him. Those clear and
penetrating eyes, looking out at him from the white-bearded
face, were sane. Crawford poured out some hot
broth, and knelt beside the invalid.</p>

<p>“This first, then talk if you must,” he said. Perrot
obeyed, then sank back and scrutinized him in frank
wonder. Crawford lighted his pipe and sat down.</p>

<p>“Where are the Mohegans?” demanded Perrot.</p>

<p>Crawford puffed and considered this question, which
contained many unuttered queries. His patient was weak,
but well enough to talk, and would only fret if left unanswered.
So Crawford began to speak, and went on to
relate the most essential parts of his own tale. While he
talked, the gaze of Perrot devoured him and mirrored the
man’s inner mind; the Frenchman passed from amazement
to incredulity, and then to a slow but still more
amazed credence.</p>

<p>In his younger days this man, who by dint of his personality
alone had conquered whole tribes, who had
walked unarmed into a council-lodge of hostile Ottawas
and had taken captives from the very torture stake, had
shown himself a very Odysseus in craft and guile; but he
had also shown that he could be all things to all men in
a most astonishing degree. So it was now. Once convinced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
of Crawford’s story, comprehending what manner
of man this was, he attempted no dissimulation but met
frankness with frankness. When the tale was done, he
uttered a shaky laugh and asked to see the Star of
Dreams. Crawford displayed the jewel, and Perrot
nodded.</p>

<p>“Thanks be to the saints!” he said slowly. “I perceive
now why I came into this land. You see, my friend, I
knew not the reason. Something urged me to the trip,
something forced me despite myself. With men like you
and me, men who obey the hidden voice of the spirit,
some reason always discloses itself. Me, I am a religious
man, as the good fathers at Green Bay have cause to
know, yet I also have some belief in the manitou of the
red men. I thought it was only a desire to see the Star
Woman again which drew me, but in truth it was something
greater and more definite. And the same with
you.”</p>

<p>Crawford smiled, not comprehending this very clearly.</p>

<p>“Not in the least, Sieur Perrot. I am here only because
of my whim.”</p>

<p>“No, my friend.” Perrot spoke gravely. “We are
agents of the unseen destiny which guards this empire of
the wilderness—remember that! It is a stern taskmaster,
this destiny; it demands much of one’s spirit and body.
Me, I believe in this unseen destiny.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe in the incredible,” said Crawford.</p>

<p>“He who denies the incredible,” came Perrot’s voice,
“must then deny God.”</p>

<p>Crawford started slightly. “I cannot answer that, Sieur
Perrot,” he said simply. “I think you may have the right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
of it. What, then, do you assign as the reason for our
presence in this place?”</p>

<p>“Ah, but we are here for France!” Perrot’s voice gathered
strength, and a swift flash leaped into his eyes. “I
struck axe into earth at Michillimackinac and took all
that region for France. I did the same at Saint Anthony’s
Falls, in the far west. With your help, I shall do the
same here——”</p>

<p>“Not with my help,” intervened Crawford coolly. “I
take no land for France, and I have no interest in the
matter. I shall stop Maclish because he murdered Phelim
Burke; I was a fool not to kill the dog when I could
have done so, but we all make mistakes. I desire to find
the Star Woman—why? Because she is unknown, inaccessible,
a mystery! That’s all. So you have come to do
the errands of King Louis, eh?”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” replied Perrot, studying him. “I came
because I was drawn by the spirit; and now I see that
work is awaiting me. Maclish—Maclish! This man
must be defeated in his aim. The Stone Men and the Dacotah
must be restrained from war. You, who know not
why you came hither—oh, the mad humour of it! Have
you, like Maclish, some dream of marrying the Star
Woman?”</p>

<p>“Heaven forbid!” Crawford laughed a little. “If you
knew her thirty years ago, she’s no slender lass now. Besides,
I’ve put the world behind me, Perrot. I’ve rotted
in irons, I’ve had my moments of happiness and of tears;
now it’s dead. I want to go over the horizon, wander on
to the end while there are things to be done and seen.
That’s all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>Perrot eyed him with a singular expression, partly cynical,
partly sad. Then it seemed as though a veil dropped
over the man’s thoughts. There was something deep in
his mind, some mystery, which he had been about to explain;
he refrained. Instead, he came to one elbow.</p>

<p>“Look!” he exclaimed. “Play your own hand; you are
a man whom I could love, and you do not interfere with
me. As for me, I shall do what is given me to do. Here
is my mission—I must turn Maclish’s game back upon
him. Maclish, the blind fool, has an awakening ahead of
him! He thinks to seize the Star Woman, make peace
between Stone Men and Dacotah, and get all the inland
trade for the bay. It is an idle dream, but I shall utilize
it, you comprehend? Me, I shall prevent the seizure,
confirm the peace between these tribes, and draw the trade
of the Stone Men to the Lake Superior posts. France
shall have a new empire here in the northwest!”</p>

<p>“Another idle dream.” Crawford shook his head.
“They are too firmly wedded to the English—but play
your own game, and I’ll play mine. So the Star Woman
is not young, eh?”</p>

<p>Perrot veiled his gaze. “How should she be?” he said
evasively. “I saw her thirty years ago, and again a few
years later. Are many of the Dacotah with her?”</p>

<p>“A few lodges only.”</p>

<p>“She is a great medicine woman, living off to herself
by this lake of many stars. She is a healer, a communer
with the good God, to whom the chiefs and medicine men
go for advice. It may be blasphemous, but I think she is
little short of a saint, my friend.”</p>

<p>Crawford did not reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>He began to perceive why this man, despite his great
deeds, was still simple Sieur Perrot instead of being a
great seigneur. Here was a man of action, yes; but behind
that a dreamer, a visionary. He had now conceived
a vague scheme not half so coherent as that which Maclish
was pursuing. Perrot was a fanatic on the question
of winning the west to France; and those who sat in high
places, having all the wilderness country they could well
handle already, wanted none of his plans. So now, driving
off into the northwest, Perrot was only too eager to
grasp at the work which he conceived to be awaiting his
hand.</p>

<p>Suddenly and without a sound, Black Kettle appeared
in the clearing and set down the hind quarters of a caribou.
He stood erect, his eyes flickering to Perrot, and grunted.</p>

<p>“My father Metaminens is awake—good! I crossed
the trail of three Stone Men and heard them talking. One
they call Red Bull is following, with three-score young
men. They have English muskets. They are going to
take the Star Woman as a wife for Red Bull.”</p>

<p>To this Perrot sat up. “Give me food, for to-morrow
we must abandon our packs and travel.”</p>

<p>Crawford shrugged, deeming travel on the morrow an
impossibility.</p>

<p>Yet, incredible as it seemed, Sieur Nicholas Perrot was
on his feet the next morning; before breakfast he was
shaven, dressed and ready to depart. Crawford held his
peace, for he realized that Perrot would regard no reason,
and in this he was right. He was not right in thinking
Perrot’s ambitious scheme impossible, however. Crafty
old Perrot knew the redskins better than any other white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
man alive, knew his own ability, and was entirely competent
to bring his dream to fruition if he had the chance.</p>

<p>For thirty years Perrot had been encountering men like
Maclish, and had one by one left them defeated behind
him. For thirty years Metaminens had ruled the western
tribes, compelling them from war to peace. No other
man was like him or would be like him again, in this singular
influence which he exerted.</p>

<p>The packs were cached away and the three men set
forth, carrying only arms and food. Perrot started off
gaily enough, but within two hours he was staggering
from exhaustion. Deaf to all protests, he drove ahead by
dint of his iron will alone. The woods were silent and
deserted, no sign of life appeared, but now Crawford
knew that Maclish and the Stone Men were not many
miles distant.</p>

<p>It was close to noon when Perrot silently collapsed in
his tracks. And now Crawford, aiding the Mohegan to
cut pine boughs and make camp, felt his last hope gone.
For days to come the old rover could only nurse back
strength, and was out of the game. Even did Standing
Bull send help, even did Frontin and Le Talon reach the
Star Woman, what could be expected from them? Nothing.
Crawford felt that in this vast wilderness three wandering
men could not be located. The immensity of the
country smote him and weighed him down. And meantime,
he knew, Maclish was sweeping the war-party forward.</p>

<p>So, when he had done what he could for Sieur Perrot,
Crawford lighted his pipe and stared gloomily through
the smoke, being tempted of the devil to leave his companions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
and plunge into the wilderness alone. He had no
sympathy with Perrot’s ambitions. He wanted to be on
his way to Frontin, pushing his quest for the Star Woman;
to sit here doing nothing was maddening. The spur of
freedom was goading him roughly. When he was playing
a lone hand, dependent only on himself, he was happiest—there
was his tragedy, if you like. Yet he could not gainsay
the urge, and this news of Maclish was like a thorn
in his flesh.</p>

<p>Now, while Crawford smoked and pondered temptation,
and the Mohegan picked over dry wood, and Perrot lay in
exhausted coma, there came quavering up through the
trees from far away a thin, queer cry. That high cry sent
a shiver over Crawford, for it was foreign to his limited
northland experience, with its uncanny cadence of shaking
mirth, its hint of weird and unearthly laughter. He
had never before heard the call of a loon. Black Kettle
stood like a dog pointing birds, but for a very different
reason; the Mohegan had never before heard the call
of a loon at high twelve.</p>

<p>“What was that?” asked Crawford. Black Kettle wrinkled
up his nose.</p>

<p>“That,” he said, putting hand to powder-horn, “was the
cry of a bird, which came from the throat of a man.”</p>

<p>Crawford saw that the redskin was puzzled and
alarmed, so asked no more questions. He loaded and
primed his gun, and came to his feet. Once again that
strange cry reached them, and this time it was much
closer. Crawford distinctly saw the Mohegan shiver to
the sound of it, as though reading something singular and
terrible in the cry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>Black Kettle gestured. Crawford followed him out
from camp among the trees. He soon realized that the
other was retracing their trail of the morning; it was an
easy one to follow, because of Perrot’s heavily plunging
tracks. A third time lifted that quavering call, now so
close upon them that Black Kettle made a startled gesture
and vanished from sight among the trees. Crawford
waited, peering through the dead brown masses of
a fallen pine.</p>

<p>A moment of waiting—then a man came into sight, following
the trail. But what a man! He was a misshapen
Indian, with a huge head set between wide shoulders, a
shaven scalp, and a fearful caricature of a face; it was
the distorted countenance of an idiot. His dress was peculiar
and remarkable, being composed of snake-skins
sewn over hide, the heads hanging intact. Once seen, this
hideous creature could never be forgotten—and perhaps
this fact was the reason for such a costume. The wilderness
is a stickler for simple and logical causes of apparently
remarkable effects.</p>

<p>Although he certainly could not see either of the hidden
men, the demented redskin now came to a sudden
halt. He peered around, lifted that horrible countenance,
and sniffed the air. A loose grin came to his lips. He
spoke aloud in a mingled Cree and English which was
comprehensible to Crawford.</p>

<p>“Where are you, Wandering Star? I bring you a talking
bark, a message from afar. I am Singing Loon, and
no man harms me because my medicine is very strong.
The Stone Men are afraid to hurt me. Where are you,
Wandering Star? I can smell you close by. I have followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
your trail a long way from the lodges of the Crees.”</p>

<p>This, in effect, was one of those unhappy beings whom
the red men believed touched by the Great Spirit, and
from whom they shrank in fear and awe; none of them, at
any cost, would lift a finger to harm this man. Crawford
did not hesitate, but laid down his gun and stepped out
to face the messenger.</p>

<p>“So here you are, Wandering Star!”</p>

<p>The idiot grinned. How he recognized Crawford was
a mystery; yet, at the creature’s girdle, Crawford saw one
of his own old and cast-off moccasins, and caught that
sniffing gesture again. Did this imbecile, then, have some
remarkable gift of scent? Perhaps.</p>

<p>“Here is my message for you.” Singing Loon fumbled
beneath his snake-skins and produced a roll of birchbark.
“I smell another man hidden, but he will not hurt me.
You should have seen how the Stone Men ran away when
they saw me yesterday! Now I shall go and frighten
them again.”</p>

<p>Giving the birch roll into Crawford’s hand, the chuckling
idiot turned and disappeared at a shambling but
rapid run.</p>

<p>Crawford stood transfixed, gripped by the wonder of
it—the way this creature had come straight to him amid
the wilderness! It was almost past his comprehension;
but to the Mohegan it was not at all incredible. Black
Kettle came into sight, crossed himself twice like the good
Christian he was, and stepped forward.</p>

<p>“I did well not to fire. That man has a powerful spirit.
What did he say?”</p>

<p>“He brought me a message.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>“His spirit knew where to find you. Good.”</p>

<p>Crawford unrolled the stiff bark. Words had been
scrawled on the inner surface of the bark, scrawled there
with a sharpened bullet. They were not easy to decipher,
some of them were lost; but he knew that Art Bocagh had
been one of Phelim Burke’s Irishmen, able to read and
write in English.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Kriqs have us saff. The Saxons are dead. The Scots
red men slue themm. Fower of us live. Wee goe to Ft. Nue
Sevann. Art Bocagh.”</p>
</div>

<p>Keen news, this, from Art the Lame! Instead of sending
Crawford’s men to the coast, Maclish had ordered the
Assiniboines to slaughter them. Four of the Irish had
somehow escaped and were safe among the Crees, on their
way to New Severn—one of the two posts remaining to
the English on the bay. Art Bocagh had sent this word
that Crawford might be warned against Maclish, and
might know where to find the remnant of his men if ever
he returned.</p>

<p>“The murdering hound!” said Crawford. A swirl of
hatred swept up in his heart. Something burst within him—all
his restraint was gone, all his self-control, all his cold
caution. He whirled on Black Kettle, a blaze in his blue
eyes. “You shall look after Metaminens—he needs only
food and rest. This message says that Red Bull has murdered
my men. I am going on ahead of him, past him,
over him, to find the Star Woman—and to find him, also!”</p>

<p>The Mohegan regarded him steadily, then made indirect
protest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>“My white brother is very angry. Does his manitou
tell him that anger is a good companion on such a trail?”</p>

<p>Crawford snarled an oath. The murder of his men
was the last straw. Every atom of his cold reserve was
swept away.</p>

<p>“If I find that dog Maclish I’ll slit his throat instead of
his face, this time! What about you and Perrot? Will
the Stone Men follow that idiot here?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the Mohegan. “They are not coming this
way. They are north of us.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be safe if the Dacotah war-party finds you,
then?”</p>

<p>“My father Metaminens is a chief of the Dacotah.”</p>

<p>“Then farewell.”</p>

<p>The Mohegan grunted in reply. Pausing only to retrieve
his musket, Crawford plunged into the trees, with
hatred of Maclish burning like a living flame in his heart.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

VENGEANCE RUNS A RED ROAD</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> helped much that Hal Crawford had hunted with
Mohawks and had worked his way during these
frozen months across an unknown wilderness. Now,
heading into the northwest, he had need of all his woods
lore, all his hard iron strength, all his sheer fighting frenzy.</p>

<p>Of this last he had no lack; indeed, his mood was little
short of actual madness, and the more he thought about
that note from Art Bocagh, the more infuriated he became.
He cared much less about himself than about the men
who trusted him. The murder of Phelim Burke had
formed his resolution to torture Maclish to the uttermost;
but the treacherous slaughter of his men smashed this
resolution, wakened in him a furious resolve to kill the
burly Scot at the first chance, and in default of him,
those who followed him.</p>

<p>During two days and nights he pressed through unbroken
woods, throwing caution to the winds, driven by
the insurgence of cold fury which had become his reckless
master. With the third morning, all the sky was black
with magnificent storm-clouds massing up from the south—huge
silver-edged billows, pile upon pile and turret upon
turret, ranked before and behind as though spelling the
immensity of the heavens and spanning that awful depth
into the infinity beyond. Stillness abode in the air that
morning, a dreadful and expectant stillness of nature,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
though now and again the cedars shook to the distant mutter
of crepitant thunder.</p>

<p>Midway of the morning, Crawford struck into the trail
of the Assiniboine war-party and followed it furiously.
Toward noon, lightning began to streak across the dark
heavens, and rain threatened at every moment. Just as
the first breath of the rain-bearing wind was felt, a tremendous
thunderbolt crashed into the trees a half-mile
distant. Hard upon that pealing reverberation, Crawford
loped into a small opening and ran slap upon two Stone
Men standing above a dead deer; the roar of the thunderbolt
had drowned the sound of the shot.</p>

<p>They saw Crawford ere he sighted them. One of the two
flung up musket and let fire, the second hurriedly reloading
empty gun. Crawford had no time to prime and fire.
Dropping his own gun as the slugs whistled over his head,
he whipped out knife and tomahawk, and the keen little
axe whirled in air like a streak of vivid light. This was a
new weapon-play to the Stone Men, and the Mohawk cast
split scalplock and skull of the first. The second warrior
was ready with his knife, but Crawford smote him terribly;
and two men lay under the singing pines with a
reeking five-point star slit in each brown forehead.</p>

<p>The pines were singing now, sure enough; the storm
hurtled down with a howl of wind to shake the high trees,
torrents of rain blurring the horizon, thunder volleying
and rumbling over the black sky. The back of winter
had broken in storm, and now was come a second and
greater upheaval of nature to complete the work.
Through the thick of it drove Crawford, on his trail, disregarding
all precaution, until in the midst of the afternoon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
he was brought to swift sanity. Somewhere wood
smoke fought against rain and wind, and catching the
pleasant reek of it, he regained his lost caution.</p>

<p>He sniffed the fragrance of birch and cedar, paused to
get direction, found the richer scent of fresh meat abroil,
and scouted the nostriled warning until he came upon the
camp of the Stone Men, lying below him on a long hillside.
There were the sodden warriors huddled about fires, others
bringing in game, muskets piled near by with powder-horns
protected against the wet by blankets. Over all
lifted the roaring blast of the storm, the thundering pæan
of destruction that swept earth and sky, and between the
bursts of rain and wind broke livid and ghastly leven-flashes.</p>

<p>Men paused cowering in this stour, and Crawford
might have circled the camp and gone on his way had he
not caught sight of Maclish stalking about. Sight of the
man brought up Crawford’s gun, but he found that by
some carelessness his powder-horn had come unstopped
and was empty. With an oath he flung it away, hurled
the musket after it, and settled down to wait.</p>

<p>The storm raged on more fiercely, then gradually lessened
as evening approached. When twilight fell the rain
had become a steady downpour, the thunder had crept
across the horizon, and Crawford was stealing down toward
the glimmering fires, the noise of his approach
drowned by the streaming swish of the rain. All too well
was it drowned, in fact. Crawford was not a rod from
the fires and the piled muskets, when an Assiniboine coming
in with a load of wood went stumbling over him, and
let out one startled howl ere the tomahawk took his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>Upon this, Crawford leaped down the hillside, a wild
and dripping figure streaking down the slope in great
bounds. The redskins raised frightened yells and broke
in mad panic. In this confusion of shouts and rain-blurred
figures, Crawford lost all sight of Maclish. Fury
spurring him, he gained the nearest fire, scattered it, and
sent the brands whirling in among the powder-horns—brand
after brand, whirling and smoking and bursting into
flame again with the fall. Next instant Crawford was
away, heading blindly into the darkness, while the bellow
of Maclish was drowned in the bursting explosion of the
black sands of death. Then, as Crawford darted into the
gloom, he lifted his head and sent up the fearful blood-yell
which even to these far redskins was known in all its
dread implication—the Mohawk war whoop.</p>

<p>“<i>Sassakouay!</i>” he shrilled it, and again. “<i>Kouay!
Sassakouay!</i>”</p>

<p>Leaving that token to chill their blood, he struck out
across the wet night. No man could follow this unseen
trail with any speed; dripping branches slapped him as
he ran, trees were thick, the darkness was impenetrable;
yet Crawford kept going after a fashion. He had failed
to smite Maclish, but in the destruction of their powder
he had dealt the enemy a shrewd enough blow.</p>

<p>Hour after hour he kept going forward, until toward
dawn he halted and burrowed for shelter. He wakened
with sun in his eyes and found the day clear as crystal,
windless, incredibly warm; spring was at hand in the
north, and the snows nearly cleared from the ground.</p>

<p>Now Crawford made good progress, unarmed save for
knife and axe, intent upon keeping ahead of the Stone Men,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
speeding toward the northwest. With afternoon, however,
he made a frightful discovery. A musket-shot crashed out
somewhere to his left, and two minutes later a wounded
deer broke cover almost beside him, swerved in hot panic,
and darted off. Crawford dropped from sight, in time to
see an Assiniboine warrior pass on the trail of the beast.</p>

<p>Crawford followed, driven now by hunger. When he
heard the finishing shot, he ran in swiftly and caught the
warrior with empty rifle. The axe-throw missed, the redskin
sent up a long yell among the trees, knife clashed on
knife; the end of this matter was that the body of the
slain deer tripped his slayer, which was crude justice
enough. Presently Crawford took up his trail again, bearing
a load of fresh meat.</p>

<p>He was now cognizant of his danger—knew that he
was between the main body of the Stone Men and their
outflung advance parties. By next morning, these had
picked up his trail. Smokes went up far and near, while
Crawford fled steadily on into the northwest, gaining
rougher and more open country, covering ground rapidly.
The signal smokes died away. During two days he pressed
on at top speed, saw no further signs of the enemy, and
began to feel certain that he had flung off all pursuit.</p>

<p>Then, abruptly, fate tripped him.</p>

<p>Crawford was following a steep hillside and came to a
broad scar where earth and trees had been riven away to
form a drop of twenty feet. As he skirted the verge of
this little chasm, a stick flew up between his legs. Crawford
fell forward, the loosened earth gave way, and he
was sent plunging head first with a small avalanche of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
earth and boulders. His descent came to crashing stop,
and the senses were knocked out of him.</p>

<p>When he wakened, it was hard upon sunset, and a stunning
sense of unreality oppressed him, for voices were
sounding close at hand. Crawford found himself unable
to move, buried nearly to the shoulders in loose earth and
gravel. He looked up, and a species of paralysis seized
on him at what he saw—not ten feet from him were five
men, four of them Assiniboine warriors, and the fifth Maclish!</p>

<p>Crawford stared. He saw that all five were weary and
hard-run, and realized that they had been following his
trail. Thus far, they had not seen him, but discovery was
inevitable. Sight of Maclish somewhat gratified him.
Those cropped ears did not show for the long hair that
now covered them, but the starry scar on the forehead
was ineradicable. Phelim Burke was somewhat avenged,
for Crawford could clearly read the changes in the face
of Maclish, the things stamped there since his last sight
of the man. Bestiality had come forth, stark animal fury—that
branded star had stung him deeper than any other
wound could have done. Spent as were his four warriors,
he still seemed vigorous. He was striding up and down,
as they tore at their food, and shook one red fist at the encircling
forest.</p>

<p>“I’ll have ye yet, ye souple deil!” he muttered. “Mark
Maclish, will ye? I’ll put marks on ye that the fiend himsel’
will look twice at! I’ll——”</p>

<p>The whitish eyes of Maclish fell upon the head and
shoulders of Crawford protruding from the hillside talus.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
For one moment the man stood petrified—then, with a
bellow to his men, hurled himself forward.</p>

<p>And thus was Hal Crawford trapped and taken.</p>

<p>Now, Maclish was not a man of wisdom, but of mere
animal cunning. Into the Stone Men he had injected his
own dream of capturing the Star Woman and thus forcing
the Dacotah to a humiliating peace. That is, the younger
men were so minded, for the older men of the tribe did
not care to meddle with the Star Woman; but the smashing
personality of Maclish drew all the more reckless warriors
after him in torrential enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Had Maclish been wise, he would have sent back for his
main force and awaited their arrival to attend to his
prisoner. He could not do this. He was wildly exultant,
striding back and forth, cursing Crawford furiously, roaring
forth orders and raging like a madman in his triumph.
The four Stone Men with him, nothing loath, readily gave
up their rest for a more exciting pastime, and were glad
to have the sport all to themselves. They gathered wood
and heaped the fire until it became that rarest of things in
Indian country—a crackling pillar of light, illumining all
things distinctly, the ruddy reflection glinting against the
carpet of the sky until it was visible for miles. Perhaps
Maclish counted that it would bring his outflung scouting
parties to the scene.</p>

<p>Crawford was dragged forward to two saplings standing
six feet apart. He was lashed by each wrist to one of
the saplings. The thongs about his ankles were then cut—and
a warrior went staggering with a howl of agony as
Crawford’s foot caught him squarely in the throat.</p>

<p>“So ye had to give a blow, eh?” Maclish came forward,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
pawing his red beard, and those glittering eyes of his devoured
the captive. “Ye’ll dance for that! Try a kick
on me if ye dare, and I’ll punch out an eye for ye!”</p>

<p>He bared his knife. Knowing the threat would be made
good, Crawford stood quiet. Maclish came to him,
ripped with hand and knife, and stripped Crawford naked
to the waist. Then, with a chuckle, Maclish grasped the
Star of Dreams and snatched it savagely away.</p>

<p>“A bonny toy!” he said softly, gloatingly, and thrust it
into a pocket. Then he looked at Crawford and grinned.
“You’ll have more than a pair o’ cropped ears when I’m
done with ye. Put your mark on me, eh? Now, ye dog,
I’ll have payment!”</p>

<p>He turned, bellowed an order at his redskins.</p>

<p>Crawford stood in silence. He had felt the thongs give
slightly about his right wrist, guessed that he had been
lashed with frayed snowshoe lacings, and took heart.
After all, he might yet go down fighting! Phelim Burke’s
words came back to him, and the warning of Frontin,
“Keep the Star safe!” The Star was lost now, and it
seemed that this loss spelled his ruin. Hopelessness surged
in upon him—then he cast off the feeling and became
again himself. What was the Star, after all, but a thing
of metal and stone?</p>

<p>The Stone Men were gathering more wood, and gleefully
laying it in a circle about the captive and the saplings—a
wide circle, not too close, as Maclish directed
them. Crawford worked at those right-hand thongs, unobserved,
and presently felt them snap. His wrist came
free, so that he swiftly gripped the sapling to keep the
fact from being noticed. This small freedom gave him no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
advantage, for he was weaponless and could not release
his other hand, stretched high to the left-hand sapling.
His heart sank, and hope fled again.</p>

<p>With their circle of brush completed, the Stone Men
now brought flaming brands from the blazing pyre and
set them into the brush, which crept into quick flame.
They stood off, and with jeer and taunt began to goad the
captive, using the few English words they knew, while
Maclish held up the Star of Dreams and bellowed imprecations.</p>

<p>The flaming circle grew, and became a torture-ring that
surrounded Crawford with hot radiance. Not waiting for
the victim to be roasted, one of the eager redskins now
came leaping in, bearing a longer brand from the fire, and
began to buffet the helpless man with this. The other
three joined in this play, leaping in and out of the fiery
circle. Their brands smote Crawford across breast
and back, and set sparks to his woollen breeches. He
clung to the saplings, half suffocated, his body flinching
from the brands, fire sweeping through his veins; the circle
of brush was all clear flame, the heat of it intolerable.</p>

<p>Then one of the redskins came close—and he had his
chance. Loosing his frenzied grip on the sapling, Crawford
sent his free right hand to the red throat. A howl
went up, a chorus of wild yells and oaths; the others
stared at the sight of Crawford gripping their comrade.
He did more than grip, however, for he brought up his
knee in a furious blow, and the red figure went limp.
Crawford dropped the body headlong into the flames, and
two others darted in to rescue the senseless man. Maclish
bellowed astounded curses, and Crawford fumbled to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
his left hand clear, but could not. He was helpless to free
that hand, and so stood waiting, arm above head.</p>

<p>The three remaining redskins now abandoned their
senseless comrade, obeyed the roars of Maclish, and
brought in more wood. At this instant there occurred a
singular and almost incredible thing. Across the firelit
space glittered a swift flash of steel, gleaming more
quickly than eye could follow. From the sapling which
held Crawford’s left wrist bound, came a slight thud.
Crawford, startled, looked up to see a tomahawk sunk into
the sapling—and his wrist was free.</p>

<p>The darkness gave birth to a horrible scream, the
Mohegan war whoop. Already Maclish and the Stone
Men were leaping for their weapons. A musket roared,
and one of the warriors pitched down. Across the open
space flitted the painted, half-naked figure of Le Talon,
knife in hand, whoop rising into the night. Then Maclish
roared at his men.</p>

<p>“Alone! He’s alone, fools——”</p>

<p>A musket crashed. The two remaining Stone Men
hurled themselves at the old Mohegan. By this time
Crawford, well clear of the fire, had been guided to Maclish
by that roaring bellow, and rushed at him barehanded,
hurts and agony forgotten in a lust for blood. The frightful
pain of his cracked and seared body only goaded him
into more maddened fury.</p>

<p>Maclish had descried that blackened figure, and whirled
to meet it. He drove in a blow to the burnt body that
stopped Crawford with sheer shock of the pain; then
lunged forward to finish it, knife glittering. In this play
Maclish was too slow. Crawford, recovering, struck the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
steel aside and launched a staggering blow which crushed
lips and teeth and dyed the red beard a darker scarlet.
Then the knife bit into him; in agonized frenzy of pain,
he struck again and again, went staggering down with
Maclish beneath him, and found his enemy limp and unresisting.
Somehow, he had driven a blow home.</p>

<p>Crawford, impelled by a mad urge, tore at the man’s
clothes and next instant had the Star of Dreams in his
hand. Now he groped for the fallen knife, seized it, and
came to one knee for the blow. He paused, glancing
around. One of the two Stone Men was motionless, Le
Talon was locked with the other in grunting combat. So
the old Mohegan was actually alone! A laugh shaking on
his lips, Crawford lifted the knife to drive it home into
Maclish—no silly thought of mercy now!</p>

<p>In the motion, darkness came upon him, and he pitched
sideways. For an instant, as his hurt body rolled on the
earth, his brain wakened to the sharp pain; then it was
dulled again.</p>

<p>Five minutes afterward, he came to himself. His head
was in the lap of Le Talon; the chief, still panting, was
pouring water over his face. Crawford sat up, groaned
sharply, then fought off the overmastering weakness and
struggled to his feet.</p>

<p>“Maclish—where is he?”</p>

<p>“The Red Bull is gone. Careful! My brother is hurt
and badly wounded.” The Mohegan rose, put out an
arm, caught Crawford as the latter reeled.</p>

<p>“Gone!” Fury roused Crawford anew. He still held
the Star of Dreams, but the body of the Scot had disappeared.
“After him, quickly! He can’t go far—after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
him, Mohegan! He must be destroyed at all costs——”</p>

<p>Calmly, Le Talon showed his right thigh, where a great
knife-gash had ripped across the muscles in a hideous
wound.</p>

<p>“The chief of the Loup nation is alone,” he said. His
grave and impressive manner steadied Crawford at once,
gave him immediate poise. “He cannot run through the
woods after the Red Bull. His friends the Dacotah are
not close; we must hurry to reach their camp before the
Stone Men come upon us.”</p>

<p>Crawford swayed, then sank down weakly; Maclish
had escaped him this time, and with good reason. He felt
the chief running deft hands over his body, rubbing bear-grease
from a little pouch into the burned skin, binding
up a knife-slash across his ribs whose flow of blood had
ebbed out his strength and robbed him of his prey. Presently
Crawford rallied and returned these services, bandaging
that frightful slash across the chief’s thigh and
learning how Le Talon had come to intervene at so opportune
a moment.</p>

<p>The Mohegan had come with one party of Dacotah,
while Frontin led another, sent by the Star Woman to
meet Perrot and Crawford. Sighting the glow of Maclish’s
fire on the sky, the Mohegan had left his party to
investigate. There had been no time to return and get the
Dacotah—therefore he had acted after his own fashion.
Now, rising, the chief collected the trophies which were
his. One Stone Man had fallen to his musket, two to his
knife. When he came to the groaning warrior whom
Crawford had gripped, he calmly added the fourth scalp
to his belt. Then he limped back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>“Ready! My brother’s medicine is very strong. Where
is Metaminens?”</p>

<p>Crawford rose, steadied himself under the giddy swirl
of pain.</p>

<p>“I left him with Black Kettle and came on—they are
behind the Assiniboines. He is well, but too weak to
travel.”</p>

<p>Crawford broke off in curses at thought of how Maclish
had escaped him. Hopeless abandon came upon him,
and with every movement sending fresh torture through
his body, he made a brief gesture to the redskin.</p>

<p>“Leave me. Go on by yourself. No use trying to get
away.”</p>

<p>Le Talon, in one fierce glance, comprehended the situation.
He smiled grimly.</p>

<p>“Very well, my brother shall see that a chief of the
Loup nation does not fear to die with him.”</p>

<p>“Plague take you!” Crawford laughed suddenly.
“Lead the way, Sagamore, and I’ll follow. You’re right;
I’ll not whine like a sick dog because my hide is sore.
After all, I have the Star of Dreams again!”</p>

<p>The chief picked up a musket, used it as a staff, and
set out into the darkness.</p>

<p>The words of the Mohegan had summoned up all Crawford’s
iron will, and he drove himself onward. His upper
body was a mass of sears and blisters, his skin cracked
and blackened, his flesh scorched; the least movement sent
quivers of agony through every complaining muscle and
the knife-wound across his ribs had let out much of his
strength. He set will to conquer flesh, and succeeded,
though every slash of whipping tree-limbs and bushes in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
the darkness brought new pain. Old Le Talon was scarce
in better shape. That one knife-slash had nearly hamstrung
his leg and each step was dragging torture, yet the
grim chief forged ahead in silence, feeling his way by instinct
toward the distant camp he had left.</p>

<p>For an hour the two men stumbled on, staggering, limping,
slowly reaching the limit of mortal endurance. Then
it was the Indian, whose fountain of strength was more
severely drained, who gave way. Le Talon leaned on his
musket and uttered a low groan.</p>

<p>“The eyes of Le Talon are dim,” he said faintly.</p>

<p>“Send up a yell,” gasped Crawford.</p>

<p>The chief lifted his head, drew a deep breath, sent a
cry quavering toward the starry splendours above. Crawford,
leaning weakly against a tree, suddenly started
erect; to that cry came an answer, a response in a voice
that he knew. A hoarse shout broke from him.</p>

<p>“Frontin! <i>Au secours!</i>”</p>

<p>“Ay, cap’n,” came the faint reply.</p>

<p>Thus heartened, the Mohegan got out his firebag, got a
spark in his tinder, got a tiny blaze running into the heart
of a dead birch. In five minutes the fire was being hastily
stamped out again, and Frontin was rushing up to them
in the darkness, with him a dozen eager young Dacotah
warriors—comprising both his own party and that of Le
Talon. Frontin was bursting with news, and poured it
out hurriedly in the darkness.</p>

<p>“We found the Star Woman, cap’n!” he exclaimed.
“That’s Le Talon with you, eh? We ran onto his camp
and were waiting to get his report on the fire-glow in the
sky. That rogue Maclish has a cursed big force of men—we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span> 
caught one of the Assiniboines and made him talk.
Eighty or ninety warriors all told. We can’t break
through to reach Perrot.”</p>

<p>“He’s safe enough behind them,” said Crawford.</p>

<p>“Death of my life! What’s the matter with your voice,
cap’n? You croak like an old raven. And there’s a most
devilish queer odour around here, like burned meat——”</p>

<p>Crawford broke into a laugh.</p>

<p>“Burned meat! For once you spoke a true word——”</p>

<p>Frontin caught him as he fell, still laughing, and passed
into unconsciousness.</p>

SOME PROBLEMS ARE BEST LEFT UNSOLVED</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A dream</span> came to Crawford. It seemed that he lay
beneath a huge pine, wind-twisted and curiously
crooked, at the very brink of a dizzy cliff. Below
and before him was outspread a magnificent panorama; a
blue lake, blue as the sky, still and deep and very clear,
and out beyond this mile after mile of green forest running
up to the horizon, until green merged imperceptibly
with blue.</p>

<p>As he lay here, it seemed that Phelim Burke came and
stood before him. This was not the scarred and broken
man he had last seen, but the laughing, gallant gentleman
of earlier days, sword at side and joy of life sparkling in
the gay eyes of him. Phelim stood there and smiled, took
a pinch of snuff, chuckled at Crawford’s astonished ejaculation.</p>

<p>“Faith, lad, did I not say I’d stay with ye? So here ye
are, Hal, and here am I.”</p>

<p>“Where?” asked Crawford in his dream.</p>

<p>“The end of our trail together, lad. Ye may deny the
world, but escape it ye cannot. What’s over the horizon
for all men, Hal?”</p>

<p>“Death,” said Crawford.</p>

<p>“Divil a bit of it,” said Phelim cheerfully, and then
walked away and was gone. So the dream passed, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
though others followed it, Crawford remembered only
this one.</p>

<p>Therefore, when he opened his eyes and found himself
conscious, he lay for a long while in perturbed wonder.
There above him was the same contorted, twisted pine
tree with its wide boughs; there was that same blue outspread
lake, far below; and he looked out afar upon that
same green forest that climbed the distant leagues to the
horizon. He was softly couched on furs and fragrant
pine. As he turned his head, he saw Frontin sitting there,
watching him.</p>

<p>“Ah!” Frontin started to him, caught his hand.
“Awake, eh? She said you’d wake this morning.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Phelim Burke?” demanded Crawford. “I tell
you, he was just here——” and he swiftly related that
dream of his. Frontin stared, then abruptly crossed himself.</p>

<p>“Dream? I’m not so sure. We’re with the Star Woman.
Here, you’re to drain this cup, then I must tell her you’re
awake.”</p>

<p>Crawford found a birch pannikin held to his lips, and
drank. He lay back and fell asleep once more, but no
further dreams came to him.</p>

<p>When he next wakened, it was in a glorious sunset that
flooded the lake and outflung forest below with a mellow
golden glow. Frontin was again with him, and gave him
meat and corn, since his hunger was sharp and avid.
Crawford sat up to eat; to his new astonishment he found
himself, if not healed, at least able to move without pain.
Frontin nodded curtly.</p>

<p>“Ay, you’re well enough, cap’n. A week we’ve been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
here—carried you and the chief. She has tended you both
with simples and herbs; a wise woman, and beautiful to
boot. There below us is the lake of many stars. Here’s
tobacco and your pipe.”</p>

<p>“Give me your hand,” said Crawford.</p>

<p>Frontin lent him a pull, and he gained his feet. Except
for some weakness, and the sore stiffness of his hurt body,
he was well enough. Something struck his breast; and,
feeling beneath the leathern shirt that clothed him, he felt
the Star of Dreams. A smile touched his lips. He leaned
back against the hole of the twisted pine tree, took pipe
and tobacco.</p>

<p>“Good. Can we talk with her?”</p>

<p>“Easily. She speaks French as good as my own—though
devil take me if I understand how she came by it!
She is but a girl.”</p>

<p>“Why hasn’t she left here? Has Maclish been stopped?
What has happened?”</p>

<p>Frontin shrugged. “My faith, she is past my comprehension!
She refused to run, and Maclish is upon us.
She is like all saints and holy folk—a trifle blind in the
material eye, and inclined to place more emphasis on the
heavenly host than the occasion warrants. If you could
see over the trees here, toward the west, you’d see the
smoke of Maclish’s campfires. His whole force is drawing
in. Well, I’d better let her know that you’re awake. She
thinks that Perrot will bring the Dacotah hosts and prevent
a fight. See if you can put any reason into her
head.”</p>

<p>With an air of sardonic gloom, Frontin departed, and
disappeared in a thick grove of trees. Crawford perceived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
that this cliff was a blunt point on the end of a
long promontory jutting out above the lake. The little
open space at the end, where he lay beneath the twisted
pine, was solidly closed in by trees.</p>

<p>Crawford was staring out over the lake again when a
quick, soft step made him turn, brought him to his feet.
So he saw the Star Woman for the first time and stood
astounded, silent; the sunset glow softened the sharp contour
of his face, kindled a flame in his hair, quickened the
deep blue of his eyes and the vibrant energy of him, so
that she stared likewise as though beholding him for the
first time.</p>

<p>To his absolute bewilderment, Crawford saw in her the
actual person visioned by Moses Deakin, and the memory
stabbed him. This was no ancient sorceress, no Indian
hag nor even woman—but a slender girl, a creature all
blue and gold, her skin white and golden, her eyes great
pools of gold-flecked lapis, her hair brighter than the flame
of sun, her fawnskin dress a rich unbeaded yellow. Between
her breasts hung by its thong a huge star of hammered
silver, all set with turquoise, stones of purest unflecked
blue. Yet it was not the sheer beauty of her
that held him awed, but the calm serenity that shone
from her.</p>

<p>Suddenly her face changed, as though her astonishment
was past. Crawford became sensible of the peculiarly
piercing quality of her gaze, and he was disconcerted to
find it not entirely friendly. When she addressed him in
French, he could not mistake her attitude of quiet aloofness.</p>

<p>“I am glad you have recovered.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>“You are—you are the Star Woman?” murmured Crawford.
“Impossible! Perrot said——”</p>

<p>“Perrot—Metaminens!” For an instant her face softened,
became radiant and glorious; a sudden deep eagerness
leaped in her eyes, an eagerness not untouched by
pain. Then again she regarded him with that cool and
aloof gaze. “How does he look? He is old?”</p>

<p>“Some men never grow old.” Crawford was confused,
staggered by all this. Surely this was not the woman
Perrot had seen thirty years ago! He stood silent, wondering.</p>

<p>“What is your errand here?” she asked quietly. “I
have talked with your friend Frontin, I know how you
tricked Standing Bull into delivering my message to the
wrong man, I know with what obstinate pertinacity you
have fought across the wilderness to reach me—but why?”</p>

<p>“To see you,” said Crawford, and under her steady
gaze, words failed him for an instant. Then he rallied.
“That is to say——”</p>

<p>“You are a hard man,” she said, ignoring his stammer.
“I quite understand why you have fled into this land from
your own people. I know what you seek—and you will
not find it. There is no peace over the horizon. Listen!”
She held up one hand. Crawford, listening, heard the
sound of distant gun-shots, saw swift distress flit into her
face. “They are killing my friends the animals,” she said
in a mournful tone. “This has been a sanctuary for man
and beast alike, until now; those Stone Men are murdering
my friends. And are you better than they? There
is no love in your heart, for I can see into it—I have seen
into it while you lay sick and muttering. You do not love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
your country, your fellow-men—anything! Have you
ever loved, indeed? Have you any capacity for love?
Or are you, too, one of the Stone Men?”</p>

<p>Crawford was taken terribly aback. Here, in the presence
of this woman, he was suddenly speechless—he, who
had dared call a king a poltroon to his very face!</p>

<p>He had never looked forward to his actual meeting with
the Star Woman; he had left that to the future. Now he
found himself indescribably impressed by the quiet poise,
the splendid personality of this girl, who was hardly yet
a woman. Her age, he guessed, could not be much more
than twenty—within a few years of it, at least.</p>

<p>He found himself strangely moved. It was as though
she had some power which broke down all his hard shell
of materialism, touching the very spirit within him. He
suddenly understood why she was a person reverenced by
all the red tribes. He felt that a touch of her hand would
be a benison. Yet that final question of hers went straight
down into the depths of his soul with its hurt, and the pipe
fell unheeded from his hand. Once he had loved, indeed,
and had seen his young wife stricken down by a bullet
from Dutch William’s troopers. And he had loved
Phelim Burke——</p>

<p>“I am what God and man have made me,” he said, but
the proud words faltered. Upon that, as he met her intent
gaze, his face changed; the harshly masterful lines
of it softened, and a swift glitter of tears stood in his blue
eyes. And she, seeing these things, was startled. “You,”
he went on softly, “you who ask—what then do you know
of love?”</p>

<p>She put a hand to her breast, and Crawford was dimly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
aware that he had given blow for blow. Somehow, this
question had hurt her. A heartache sprang into her eyes.</p>

<p>“Ah! I think that there are two different men in you,”
she said quietly, and Crawford was astonished that she
spoke of him, not of herself. “I have been angry because,
had it not been for you, Maclish and those Stone Men
might have stayed away. But I have been wrong, very
wrong. You are not what I thought—you see, I have not
looked into your eyes before this! After all, I think that
you are an agent of destiny, which we cannot escape——”</p>

<p>Crawford started. “Perrot said that! And now you!”</p>

<p>“Perrot said that? Metaminens? All my life I have
hungered to see Metaminens.” Her voice lingered on the
name with swift tenderness. Then she put out her hand
and took that of Crawford, and a smile touched her lips
gloriously. “And now he is coming, and it is you who
bring him to me! Ah, I was wrong to be angry against
you.”</p>

<p>Crawford was astonished and bewildered. Perrot had
seen this woman thirty years ago, and again ten years
afterward—yet the thing was impossible, rankly impossible!
She herself implied that she had never seen Perrot!
Looking into her eyes, he could think only of Perrot’s
words: “I think she is a saint!” Upon him rushed the
feeling that he was in touch with some deeply poignant
mystery, that he was treading holy ground, that from
enmity he had somehow won her to friendliness and confidence;
and he was awed before her clear eyes.</p>

<p>“I do not wonder,” he said slowly, “that men look up
to you as a being apart!”</p>

<p>She smiled slightly and loosened her grip of his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>“And I do not wonder that men follow you gladly,” she
returned. “But no, no! I am only a woman, and to protect
myself I manage to rule the tribes as I have been
taught. I love them, I help them, I bring common-sense
and what I have learned of healing and spiritual aid to
their help—that is all. Because they believe in me, they
find the help they seek.”</p>

<p>“But who, then, taught you?” Crawford could not
check his words. “Who showed you this trail? Where
did you come from, you who are no Indian but a white
woman?”</p>

<p>Her eyes widened a little. He saw that same hurt look
come into them, that look of heartache and pain.</p>

<p>“Ah, I do not know!” she said softly. “I do not know,
my friend. There is only one who could tell me; and
some day my mother said he would come to tell me—Metaminens!
There, look on the other side of this
crooked tree, this sacred tree which the tribes worship as
holy—you will see who taught me.”</p>

<p>Crawford obeyed her gesture, and rounded the bole of
that great tree. There, carved in the bark, he saw a cross,
and below this a little mound of grassy earth.</p>

<p>His eyes were opened suddenly; a rush of emotion
seized upon him, as he comprehended all that this girl did
not comprehend. He understood that it was not she whom
Sieur Nicholas Perrot had seen in past years, but another;
now he remembered that veil which had dropped
over Perrot’s words, that swift checking of too impulsive
speech; and he knew that he had been given to understand
something which must not pass his lips. He silently
took the girl’s hand again and bowed over it, and as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
touched his lips to her fingers, they tightened on his. It
was between them a tacit exchange of sympathy, of friendliness——</p>

<p>A burst of shots sounded, and the Star Woman twisted
about.</p>

<p>“Oh! Come quickly.”</p>

<p>The magic spell was broken; the shots of the Stone
Men were drums of materialism, grimly recalling Crawford
to the present. He drew a deep breath and turned to
accompany her toward the thick trees that fringed in the
little point of rock. He brought himself to face what he
knew well must be a desperate situation.</p>

<p>“How many men have you here?” he demanded, his
thinly chiseled features tensed and alert once more. The
Star Woman gave him a curious look, sensing the change.</p>

<p>“Standing Bull has fifteen of his young men here; Old
Bear brought five warriors from the Teton clan, to the
west. With you, Frontin, and the Mohegan, that makes
twenty-five.”</p>

<p>“Have you healed Le Talon, then, as you have me?”</p>

<p>A sad smile touched her lips. “I cannot do more than
is humanly possible. The chief’s leg will always be crippled,
for flesh and muscles are shrunken.”</p>

<p>Now, in among the thick trees, the Star Woman pointed
out her own lodge, a bark structure dimly visible to the
left; Crawford gathered that this was some sort of a sacred
grove, where she lived inviolate. Presently the trees
thinned and they came to a clearing; here were the bark
lodges of the Issanti Dacotah, and two hide tepees of the
Teton clan.</p>

<p>Now Crawford understood the lay of the land, and for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
a little there glowed within him a sudden flash of hope.
All this abode of the Star Woman lay upon the apex of a
rude triangle of rock—the lofty brow of a cliff that jutted
out into the lake like a ship’s prow, shielded on either converging
side by precipitous descents to the land and water
below. Across the base of this triangle the higher ground
ran down steeply to the forest beyond; yet here there was
a natural defence formed by a deep ravine which ran in
from either side, leaving at the centre an open space of
barely twenty yards in width. Crawford eyed all this
with immense satisfaction, then saw Frontin approaching
and turned.</p>

<p>At the edge of the grove, flooded with golden glory in
the sunset light, were gathered some of the Star Woman’s
defenders—a number of Standing Bull’s warriors, fitting
thin iron heads to shafts for the bows; Old Bear and his
handful of Tetons, wild and fierce men who carried round
shields of hide; and seated against a tree was Le Talon,
dressing his scalplock with grease and looking over his
paint-pouch. Frontin came up, bowed with a certain air
of deference to the Star Woman, and spoke to Crawford.</p>

<p>“How like you the situation, cap’n? Standing Bull and
some of his warriors are scouting the enemy. We’ll hear
from them before dark.”</p>

<p>“Things might be worse,” and Crawford pointed to the
narrow space between the ravines ahead. “There’s the
point to defend, with the ground falling away in front.
Excellent! Who is in charge?”</p>

<p>“Ask madame,” said Frontin, and Crawford turned to
the Star Woman. To his surprise, she hesitated, anxiety
in her face.</p>

<p>“I should like you to be in charge,” she said. “And yet—there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
must be no fighting if it can be avoided! Blood
must not be shed in this place. It is sacred to me, and to
the red men——”</p>

<p>As though to resolve her doubts, a thin, high yell arose
from the forest below, where the green trees ran into hilly
country. At sound of this yell, a delighted grunt went up
from the Dacotah. One of them spoke out.</p>

<p>“That is the scalp-yell of Standing Bull; he has counted
coup. <i>Was-te!</i> Good!”</p>

<p>“I leave everything in your hands,” said the girl hastily,
an expression of despair flitting across her face. She
turned to the warriors, ordered them to obey Crawford,
and then walked in among the trees and vanished in the
direction of her own abode. Frontin glanced after her
with his darkly sardonic gaze, and shrugged.</p>

<p>“The olden fanes fall crumbling, the chatter of priests
and the mystery of woman alike are withered and desolate
in the breath of ambition,” he murmured. “That
crooked pine tree under which you lay, my cap’n, was a
sacred tree among these people; blood must not touch this
ground. Well, all that is ended! The white man has
come into the land, and oddly enough he reveres the same
symbol—a crooked Tree. The difference is, that his is
stained with blood——”</p>

<p>Frontin broke off abruptly, as though fearing to trace
his thought farther.</p>

<p>“Forget your moralizing and get to work,” said Crawford
curtly. He walked over to Old Bear, and the Teton
chief grinned at him in recognition. “Old Bear, put your
warriors to work! A barricade must be laid across this
narrow ground to-night. Frontin, have we any guns?”</p>

<p>“Half a dozen,” said Frontin. “Standing Bull and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
scouts are using them. Will you have the barricade laid
with bastions and chevaux-de-frise in approved fashion——”</p>

<p>“Any way at all, so it be laid,” said Crawford. “What
water and food have we?”</p>

<p>“A spring, and a fair stock of meat and corn.”</p>

<p>The warriors fell to work, with Old Bear and Frontin
ordering them. Crawford walked across to the Mohegan,
who met his eyes and chuckled.</p>

<p>“My brother is well again; that is good! His medicine
is strong. To-morrow he shall see how a chief of the Loup
nation dies, that he may tell Metaminens the story.”</p>

<p>“We’ll not die to-morrow,” said Crawford. “No word
has come from Perrot or from the Dacotah to the south?”</p>

<p>“None. The place here is surrounded and cut off.
Ah! Here is Standing Bull!”</p>

<p>Across the neck of ground appeared the old Dacotah
chief, a number of warriors following with shrill yelps.
He came to where Crawford stood, and a flash of exultation
was in his eyes, as he touched the red object at his
belt.</p>

<p>“We have taught the Stone Men a lesson,” he said.
“My brother is well? Good. Did I not say that his
medicine would bring him here?”</p>

<p>Crawford laughed. “You old rascal! I half believe
you were right about it. You have left scouts to watch
the enemy?”</p>

<p>“Yes. The Stone Men are making camp and cooking
meat. Red Bull is with them.”</p>

<p>Crawford nodded. He knew that nothing short of death
itself would stop Maclish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Late</span> that night, while the thin crescent of a new

<p>There was a bitterness in Frontin’s voice that made
Crawford sit up sharply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>“Anything wrong?”</p>

<p>“No. Go to sleep again, cap’n.”</p>

<p>Instead, Crawford got out his pipe, borrowed fire from
the other man, and they smoked together. After a little,
with the peaceful solitude of the far-flung water and forest
below acting upon him, Crawford broke the silence.</p>

<p>“See here, Frontin! If I don’t get out of this, you
make for the bay. Those Irishmen will be at New
Severn——”</p>

<p>“Devil take you, be silent!” snapped Frontin roughly.
“Listen! You hear the wind singing in those branches
above us? Well, that is our requiem mass. We have
failed in the world, and now God brings us to an end of
the trail in this place—we have gained the glory of such
a tomb as few men know, and the choral requiem of a
sacred tree!”</p>

<p>“What the devil has put you in this mood?”</p>

<p>“The devil that is in me. Oh, I am sick, sick at heart!”
broke out Frontin. “When I look into the eyes of this
Star Woman, I am frightened. She is not of this earth.
She is a fairy. She has been put here by magic—oh, the
devil! I cannot understand it at all.”</p>

<p>Crawford, who felt that he could understand it perfectly,
held his peace. Suddenly a sharp sound drifted to
them from somewhere far below, and was repeated.</p>

<p>“What is that noise?” Frontin started.</p>

<p>“The bark of a wolf,” said Crawford.</p>

<p>Frontin jerked to his feet. “Then I have learned something,”
he said drily, “for until now I have never heard of
a wolf swimming.”</p>

<p>He strode away into the trees, and presently returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
with Standing Bull and two Dacotah warriors. They
joined Crawford and listened. Once more that long wolf-call
came up from the water below. At this moment another
Dacotah hurried to join them, with eager words.</p>

<p>“Le Talon says that he hears the voice of his brother
Black Kettle!”</p>

<p>Standing Bull uttered a sharp exclamation, and the
three Dacotah vanished.</p>

<p>“There is a path down to the water,” said the chief.
“Let us wait. If the Stone Men are down there, the path
must be closed.”</p>

<p>The three remained silent. They heard nothing more
for a long space. The dark star-glinting lake, where all
the constellations of the sky were mirrored in placid glory,
gave up no further sound—until, abruptly, a musket
crashed out from the shore below. Two made answer
from the water, with ruddy flashes, and then pealed up a
sharp chorus of yells. Again silence ensued, until Standing
Bull spoke up.</p>

<p>“The Stone Men are on the lake in canoes. Fear not,
my young men will close this cliff trail——”</p>

<p>A rumbling crash of rock, a yell, and then a triumphant
Dacotah whoop came close on his words to show their
truth. Again silence. Crawford waited, with hope tugging
at him. If Black Kettle had arrived, Perrot and the Dacotah
warriors under Yellow Sky must have come up!</p>

<p>The Star Woman and most of her men were hastily
gathering to the scene, when the three Dacotah came
climbing to the cliff-verge again, and with them two weary,
wounded men. One was the Mohegan, Black Kettle; the
other was a sub-chief from the southern villages of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
Dacotah. These came to the Star Woman and made report,
while all around hung on their words.</p>

<p>“Yellow Sky and a hundred Issanti warriors are on the
trail. They have Metaminens with them. He sent Black
Kettle and Wounded Crane on ahead. Fifty others of
The Men have gone around by the eastward of the lake,
to cut off the Assiniboine retreat. It is the word of Metaminens
that Red Bull be detained for two days. Before
the second sun has set, Metaminens will be here.”</p>

<p>Crawford caught a significant grunt from Frontin, and
gave up hope. Two days would see a different end to this
story! The Star Woman sent the new arrivals away with
the other braves, and came to the two white men.</p>

<p>“You heard?” she exclaimed, a thrill in her voice. “Tell
me, what is in the mind of Metaminens? What does he
mean to do?”</p>

<p>“Save you from Maclish,” said Crawford, “make peace
with the Stone Men, and win them over to the French
cause. How he can do that, remains to be seen.”</p>

<p>“You do not know Metaminens, if you doubt him!”
was her flashing answer. “So he needs two days? Then
we must stop all fighting until he arrives.”</p>

<p>“But Maclish must not know that he is coming,” said
Crawford, unwilling to dispel her confidence. She laughed
softly and was gone in the darkness. Frontin uttered a
low laugh.</p>

<p>“She wants peace, Perrot wants peace, Maclish wants
peace—what beautiful irony! All three lose. She is too
proud to pay the price of peace, Perrot will be too late to
save us, and—who, then, will win the game?”</p>

<p>“Who, then?” demanded Crawford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>“Death,” said Frontin gloomily. “We are the only ones
to win, you and I! We win what we came here to
seek. Meantime, go back to sleep, for to-morrow we
work.”</p>

<p>Crawford obeyed.</p>

<p>When sunrise broke, Crawford wakened much his old
self, save for an unavoidable soreness. He interviewed
Black Kettle and learned that Perrot was still too weak
to travel fast, and the Dacotah would not go on without
him; neither he nor they dreamed that the Star Woman
was in acute peril.</p>

<p>The scouts reported that the force of Maclish was
encamped without any immediate sign of attack. Crawford,
after disposing his available force along the one assailable
front, now protected by an excellent breastwork,
joined them at breakfast and awaited the next move.
Ere the meal was finished, the Star Woman appeared and
came to Crawford and Frontin.</p>

<p>“We must send a messenger to Maclish at once,” she
said.</p>

<p>“Maclish is already sending one to us,” rejoined Crawford.
Her dark blue eyes widened upon him.</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“I don’t; but I know Maclish.”</p>

<p>While she was still staring at him perplexedly, one of
the scouts came leaping in across the breastwork with
news. An Assiniboine chief had left Maclish’s camp and
was coming toward the spot. He was unarmed, carrying
only belts and a roll of birchbark. Crawford smiled at
these tidings, gave orders that the chief be brought in, and
met the startled gaze of the Star Woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>“You see, I spoke truly. Do you imagine that we are
masters of this situation? Not at all, I assure you.”</p>

<p>“I will go out and see this man Maclish——”</p>

<p>“Then, understand what will happen!” Crawford
spoke sternly, gravely, his tone startling her anew. “He
will seize you, and will then have everything. Do you
imagine that he has any respect or reverence for you?
He is an animal, an animal! If you do not believe me,
ask Frontin, who knows him.”</p>

<p>She believed him and said no more; only a perceptible
pallor crept over her face as she waited, and deepened
there.</p>

<p>There was no long delay. Presently the chief of the
Stone Men was led forward by two of the Dacotah scouts.
He was a young man, naked to the waist, bearing two
long bead belts around his neck and carrying a rolled
strip of bark. He came to the Star Woman, met her gaze
with grave dignity; then, removing his belts, he delivered
them. He spoke in the Dacotah tongue, which Standing
Bull translated for Crawford and Frontin.</p>

<p>“I bring you a belt from our father Maclish, called
Red Bull,” he said, handing the first belt to the Star
Woman. “It says this: ‘Place yourself in my hands and
avoid the shedding of blood. I will take you into my
lodge and you shall have honour among the Stone Men.
The Dacotah and their brethren the Stone Men shall dwell
in peace together, and their nation will become great. A
tree of peace shall be planted whose branches will overshadow
all the western country. If you assent to this,
return yourself with my messenger.’ Thus says the first
belt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>“Here is the second belt,” and the envoy held out one
composed of black beads. “This is what it says.
‘If you do not return with my messenger; if you do not
come to me at once, then I will come and take you. All
those men with you shall go into the kettles of the Stone
Men. You cannot escape me, and the blood of your young
men will be upon your head.’ Thus speaks the second
belt.”</p>

<p>Now Crawford had on this morning hung the Star of
Dreams outside his shirt, since the metal irked his tender
new skin. The Assiniboine glanced around, saw the jewel,
and in silence held out his roll of birch to Crawford, who
took it. The Star Woman came to him, bitter anxiety in
her eyes, yet with a proud anger flaming behind the anxiety.</p>

<p>“You have heard those belts? I cannot give myself to
this man—sooner would I leap into the lake below! How
can we gain time?”</p>

<p>“We cannot,” said Crawford grimly, and unrolled the
birch. “Now let us see what message the Red Bull has
sent to me.”</p>

<p>He studied the scrawl in the fresh-peeled bark, and then
read it aloud, translating it into French that all might
comprehend. To the woman who listened at his elbow
with bated breath, to the dark warriors standing around,
that message came with a blunt shock—a shock which betrayed
the whole truth to them.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Make her yield to me, and I will spare you and Frontin.
I have you surrounded and will grant no quarter to others;
not one of the Nadouisioux must live to tell of this matter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
If she will not yield, then persuade her out to speak with me,
and you shall still be spared. Refuse, and I finish the torture
that I began a while back.”</p>
</div>

<p>The red men standing around uttered a low chorus of
grunts and waited. Crawford looked up, met the lapis
eyes of the Star Woman, found them wide with horrified
comprehension.</p>

<p>“You understand?” he said gravely. “This fool thinks
me coward enough to buy my life with you; yet he means
to keep no promises. It is essential to his scheme that
none of your warriors should remain alive to tell the Dacotah
the truth—and he means to murder me as well, despite
these promises.”</p>

<p>The Star Woman tried to speak, and the words died on
her lips. Then, at the third attempt, she made hoarse
response.</p>

<p>“But Metaminens! We must gain time—if I went out
to meet this man——”</p>

<p>“You would be seized, your men would lose heart, and
be slain. There is only one way in which we can gain
time.”</p>

<p>Crawford touched his knife significantly, and a grunt
of assent broke from the braves. Then all were silent,
awaiting her response.</p>

<p>This was slow in coming. Despair swept the face of
the girl, followed by a swift flush of anger; but this ebbed
away instantly, and was succeeded by a deathly pallor.
Now, beyond all evasion, the Star Woman perceived that
she must abandon everything, that peace and temporizing
were alike impossible, that there was but one issue. Crawford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
spoke again, since he dared not risk any misunderstanding
in her mind.</p>

<p>“Maclish knows better than to trust himself among us.
You can still win the whole game—at a price. Yield to
his terms, go to his camp, put yourself at his mercy; and
peace will follow. True, we others will be slain none the
less—yet there will be peace until Perrot comes to take
vengeance. Then what?”</p>

<p>To this bitter speech, Frontin added cool, sardonic
words which bit far deeper than he could know.</p>

<p>“Madame, this affair is perfectly simple—it is as logical
and dispassionate as a problem in geometry! Look
you, now. Our only possible hope is in Sieur Perrot, is it
not? Well, Perrot’s only possible hope is in us <i>likewise</i>!
This Maclish will attack, and then what happens? With
luck, we shall kill him; certainly, we shall do our best.
Perhaps he will kill us. In any case, neither he nor we
can win this game. But if we can hold out a little while,
Perrot may yet find you alive. So the only one who can
win this game is Perrot—<i>voilà!</i>”</p>

<p>In the startled silence that ensued, the Assiniboine envoy,
who spoke no French, stabbed with curious eyes at
Crawford, the Star Woman, the chiefs around. Frontin’s
words brought home to them that there was only one
wild, desperate hope left—not for them, but for Perrot.
If they chose to die here, then the Star Woman might or
might not remain alive until Perrot came. In any case,
Perrot and the Dacotah host would strike Maclish like a
thunderbolt, all unperceived, and could dictate his own
terms. Crawford laughed a little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>“And I thought Perrot’s dream was impossible!” he
murmured.</p>

<p>A swift glory leaped into the lovely face of the Star
Woman. She, who all her life had heard so much of
Perrot, yet who did not know the true reason of her longing
to see that man, suddenly leaped at this one forlorn
hope.</p>

<p>“I play the hand of Metaminens!” she exclaimed, her
eyes flashing around the circle of dark faces. “That is
my decision—yet I cannot command you to die, my
friends. Wandering Star, I leave this matter to you. Return
a belt to Maclish in my name.”</p>

<p>Then, not awaiting the issue, she turned and passed
among the trees toward the grave that lay beneath the
crooked pine. Crawford, in turn, spoke to Standing Bull.</p>

<p>“I choose to fight it out, Dacotah. Make what answer
you like to the Stone Men.”</p>

<p>Standing Bull had no need to ask the temper of the
warriors around. Teton and Issanti and Mohegan, all
fastened upon him a fiercely exultant regard. Le Talon
alone was quite indifferent; seated against his tree, he
was calmly streaking his features with vermilion as though
quite certain of the outcome. Standing Bull took from
his belt the grisly trophy which he had fetched in the previous
evening, and handed it to the Assiniboine.</p>

<p>“The scalps of the Stone Men are like the feathers of
crows,” he said. “A chief of The Men does not care to
keep them. Take this to your chiefs as a belt from the
Star Woman. To the Red Bull take this message.” And
unstopping his powder-horn, he sprinkled on the scalp a
few grains of powder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>“We have kettles for you all,” returned the Assiniboine.
“To-night we shall feast upon the hearts of the Dacotah.”
Then, stalking away, he leaped the barricade and was gone
with a shrill yelp.</p>

<p>“Quick, now!” Crawford was at the side of the Dacotah
chief with swift orders. “Put ten of your men at the
breastwork with all the muskets. Frontin, take a gun!
Black Kettle has his own. Send out the other warriors
to oppose their advance; tell them to fall back on the position
here and to save themselves so far as possible.”</p>

<p>While these directions went into effect, Crawford, who
knew himself still unable to endure the heavy recoil of a
musket, provided himself with several tomahawks and
took post at the center of the barricade, where Frontin
and Black Kettle joined him. Standing Bull himself was
gone into the trees beyond with his scouts. Now Crawford
heard the voice of Le Talon, and saw the crippled
chief limping to him. There, his injured leg bolstered up,
Le Talon stood facing the clearing beyond, his voice rising
and falling in a weird monotone as it lifted to the morning
sky the recital of his deeds and trophies.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, a musket banged in the forest, followed
by others. The Stone Men could have little ammunition
left, and what they had was now being rapidly expended.
Bullets clipped the high trees, while Crawford and his
men waited for the battle to be broken upon them; and on
the ground in little sheaves lay the scarlet arrows which
were the peculiar token of the Star Woman. Yells resounded,
and among them Crawford thrilled to the bull-like
roar of Maclish.</p>

<p>Now came Standing Bull, darting from the trees and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
leaping over the barricade, reaching for arrows to fill his
empty quiver.</p>

<p>“Wah!” he panted, fiercely exultant. “They come—all
of them!”</p>

<p>Among the trees appeared other of the Dacotah, fighting
as they retreated, arrows flashing around them. Man by
man they came in—but not all of them. Five had fallen.
A long yell shrilled up from the trees as the enemy sighted
the barricade and paused.</p>

<p>“Fire one at a time, and low,” commanded Crawford.</p>

<p>On the word, the Stone Men came bursting from cover
in one wild charge, as though to overwhelm the defenders
in a great wave, with the roar of Maclish to spur them on.
Stripped and painted, arrows and bullets hurtling over
them into the barricade, the solidly massed redskins came
pouring across the clearing, converging on the narrow
line of felled trees.</p>

<p>“Let fire,” said Crawford, and Frontin dropped a
chief who was in the lead.</p>

<p>The muskets spouted white flame and smoke; at that
short distance even the Dacotah could not miss, and their
bullets ploughed furrows of death through the enemy.
The hum and twang of loosened bowstrings, the whistling
song of feathered shafts, the panting grunts of men, rippled
down the line; those short, powerful Teton bows,
which could send a shaft through and through a bison, uttered
a deeper and more vibrant note. The Assiniboine
whoop changed to a death-yell. Their vanguard stumbled,
melted away, plunged headlong. A red wall of the
dead formed up, across which mounted the living ranks behind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
only to catch anew the full sweep of those scarlet
shafts which pierced two men at once.</p>

<p>None the less, they swept forward in stubborn fury,
rolled on to the barricade, paused there like a breaking
wave and then crested above it. As that tide of men burst
high and fell inward, Crawford gave up all for lost.</p>

<p>He drove out with his keen little axes, sending each
through the air like a lane of living light, each one driving
home relentlessly and surely. A Dacotah beside him
gasped and fell under a stone club; Crawford axed the
slayer, saw Le Talon engaged with two stocky Assiniboines,
heard the Mohegan yell volley up. No sign of
Maclish caught his eye. Behind the storm of tumultuous
figures, the Tetons drove out with their long lances, though
Old Bear was now down, stabbing and stabbed in red
ruin.</p>

<p>Then, like a flash, all was changed. A new yell arose—men
paused, staring. Crawford turned, to see the Star
Woman coming from the trees, coming forward to the
barricade. At sight of her the Stone Men hesitated—then
the reloading was accomplished, the muskets began
to roar again, bowstrings twanged, scarlet shafts pierced
swift and deep. Those of the enemy who had mounted
the barricade were swept away, and upon the others
poured a deadly rain. These could endure no longer. It
was not their mode of warfare, and their fanatic exultation
was blasted by the fearful toll of death. Their ranks
melted, and they were gone.</p>

<p>Crawford glanced down the line, lips compressed. Le
Talon was dead, with his two assailants. Old Bear was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
gone. Four Tetons remained, with Standing Bull and five
Issanti. Crawford turned to the Star Woman.</p>

<p>“Back!” he said sternly. “We cannot risk——”</p>

<p>Her eyes met his gaze steadily, and a smile was on her
lips.</p>

<p>“I remain here with you and with my men,” she said
quietly. Crawford knew better than to oppose, and
changed his tactics instantly.</p>

<p>“Very well,” he said. “But we cannot hold this barricade
now—the next rush will end it. Back to the trees,
all of us! We must make ready to hold the point of the
cliff. That will be our last defence.”</p>

<p>She comprehended, and turned back to the grove.
Crawford sent Standing Bull and the Dacotah after her,
then turned to Frontin and Black Kettle, who were unhurt.</p>

<p>“Load all the muskets and hold this barricade,” he said
quietly.</p>

<p>“Ay, cap’n,” rejoined Frontin, laughing a little.</p>

<p>Crawford waited. Already the arrows were singing in
from the trees, and presently he saw that which he had
feared. The Stone Men were taking advantage of the ravine
at either side the clearing; sheltered there, they began
to pour in a steady fire upon the barricade, in the
centre of which remained Frontin and Black Kettle. As
the muskets began to crash out their message, Crawford
withdrew to the trees of the sacred grove, an arrow burning
his arm ere he reached the cover.</p>

<p>He passed in among the trees. Then, ahead of him,
he saw the Dacotah grouped, saw them open out as he
approached. Amid them, half hidden by the hanging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
limbs of a cedar, he saw something fair and yellow. An
oath dashed from his lips, and he leaped forward to kneel
beside the Star Woman.</p>

<p>From the centre of that star of silver and turquoise
which hung against her breast protruded the feathered
shaft of an arrow.</p>

<p>Crawford looked up at Standing Bull. “Carry her back
there, beneath the crooked pine; the turquoise star has deflected
the arrow—she may live. I will come to her. Set
your men to work felling trees. Hurry!”</p>

<p>The Dacotah obeyed in dark silence.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

SOMETIMES SUNRISE CAN COME TOO LATE</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Noon</span> passed into afternoon, and still the outer barricade
remained untaken, for Black Kettle and
Frontin held it. They were excellent shots, and
with two Dacotah to keep the muskets loaded, they twice
checked half-hearted charges and searched the farther
trees and the lips of the ravine with deadly bullets. Maclish
could not prod his men to face that barricade again,
after the fearful loss of the first attack. Having fired
away their last powder and exhausted their initial ardour,
the Stone Men kept up a sullen discharge of arrows and
would do no more.</p>

<p>The Star Woman, who had lost much blood but was in
no danger, lay at the verge of the cliff under the crooked
tree, near the sleeping-place of her mother; and she, too,
slept in an exhausted slumber. Crawford, who had tended
her wound, was glad enough to have it so, for his hands
were full.</p>

<p>He laboured with the Dacotah, though in grim certainty
of the end; the Star Woman’s wound from a chance shaft
had filled them all with deadly fury. Standing Bull sent
up repeated signal smokes, hoping that Perrot’s war-party
would see them, but as the afternoon drew on, no
response came from those leagues of silent green forest
outspread beyond the lake of many stars. And, now and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
again, to the musketry of Frontin and Black Kettle rang
out the death-yells of the Stone Men.</p>

<p>Where the sacred grove thinned out toward the sacred
tree, Crawford laid his second breastwork, enclosing the
tip of the craggy triangle. Tree after tree crashed down
and was laid in position, wide boughs projecting. When
this had been done, the warriors fell to work collecting
old shafts or making new ones, inserting sharp flints
into the ball of each war-club or <i>casse-tête</i>, stoically preparing
for the last fight here at the crooked tree.</p>

<p>The wounded warrior squatting beside the couch of the
Star Woman sent a call to Crawford. He came to her
quickly, knelt beside her; in his bronzed features was a
great tenderness, and his fingers touched her brow,
smoothing back the golden hair.</p>

<p>“You must stay quiet, Star Woman!”</p>

<p>She smiled a little. “Fear not, Wandering Star. In
my sleep I have called Metaminens, and he is coming.”</p>

<p>“Can you reach him where signal smokes have failed,
then?” asked Crawford bitterly. She put her hand to his,
gripping his fingers.</p>

<p>“I am sorry that at first I did not understand what sort
of man you are, Wandering Star; I did not guess what
tenderness could be in you. I am only a weak woman,
fighting the world with what weapons are mine, as my
mother taught me. Now—I have thought of how to prevent
more bloodshed, to save you and these others.”</p>

<p>Crawford’s steel-blue eyes hardened slightly. “How?”</p>

<p>“Maclish does not know that Metaminens is coming,
and he will be trapped by to-morrow. Send him word
that I am dying; let one of his men come and see me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
wounded. The Stone Men will be frightened, and Maclish
will not know what to do——”</p>

<p>“No,” said Crawford. “Maclish means to have you
alive or dead; he has gone too far to draw out now. If
he knew that the Dacotah host was coming, he and the
Stone Men might flee—but he would refuse to believe it,
from our lips. Even if he believed it, he would attack us
at once, in order to seize you and so buy his safety from
Perrot. There is no way out of this imbroglio, Star
Woman—except to hold out while we can.”</p>

<p>The eyes of the girl closed.</p>

<p>“You are right. I will send out my spirit to reach
Metaminens, as my mother used to do. It is our only
hope.”</p>

<p>Crawford stood for a moment regarding the girl, wondering
at her words. He remembered how Perrot had
spoken of the Star Woman’s influence in his life. Could
it be that Perrot was the father of this girl? Then whence
had come her mother—a white woman, certainly? That
would never be known now, for this girl herself knew
nothing of her past.</p>

<p>As he stood, those glorious lapis eyes opened, swept up
to meet his gaze, and a smile touched the lips of the Star
Woman. In this smile, this look, there passed between
the two something more than words could have told—a
touch of the spirit beyond any speech. Then Crawford
found the Dacotah chief at his elbow.</p>

<p>“My brother Black Kettle is calling!”</p>

<p>“Come.” With Standing Bull, Crawford turned to the
trees of the grove, and rapidly passed among them, suddenly
conscious that muskets had been banging all this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
while. When they sighted the outer barricade, Frontin
saw them, wiped his powder-blackened face, and shouted:</p>

<p>“Four charges left, cap’n!”</p>

<p>“Come in, then.”</p>

<p>Followed by a hail of shafts, Frontin and the Mohegan
came bounding across to the trees, carrying a musket each.
From the outer forest was ascending a din of shouts, yells,
long chorused chants, pierced by the bellow of Maclish.
Crawford understood that the Stone Men were working
themselves up to battle fury, singing the scalp dance, preparing
for one final assault. He turned to Standing Bull.</p>

<p>“Call up your men. When the enemy come, let them
take the outer breastwork, but hold the grove, falling back
on the last defence. Frontin, go back to the crooked tree
with the muskets. We must check them there until morning.”</p>

<p>Hardly had he spoken, when an up-pouring yell and a
whistle of shafts betrayed that the Stone Men were advancing.
Now the Dacotah came darting forward to occupy
the grove, and as they did so, the enemy poured into
sight from the farther trees, sending a hail of shafts over
the breastwork into the grove, and Crawford caught a
glimpse of Maclish urging them on from the rear.</p>

<p>Now the bows thrummed, and the long shafts sang
down the level sunlight of waning afternoon. Men stumbled
and died, or leaped in midair like stricken deer; but
the defenders were all too few. Up to the outer barricade
swept the yelling flood, paused for an instant, and then
came surging over. Crawford shouted his men back,
hurled his axe into the brain of the nearest Assiniboine,
then went leaping for cover. Pealing up yells of triumph,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
the Stone Men burst across the barricade and flooded in
upon the grove.</p>

<p>There again the bowstrings twanged, and shafts whistled
fiercely into naked bodies, but there was no checking
this assault. Through the grove swept the Stone Men,
scarcely checked by the Dacotah arrows. Crawford
gained the breastwork, defending the last bit of ground
around the crooked tree, and was joined there by Standing
Bull and four warriors. The others were gone.</p>

<p>No orders were needed. The Dacotah caught up fresh
arrows, Frontin and Black Kettle lay with matches alight.
As the grove vomited forth the oncoming Stone Men, the
four last charges of powder roared out one by one, arrows
flew as fast as fingers could work the strings. Smitten by
this blast of death, dismayed to find a fresh barricade facing
them, the Assiniboines paused, wavered, broke back
abruptly to cover. The storm abruptly ceased, the bellow
of Maclish quelling the arrow-flight. The sun was just
sinking from sight behind the western trees.</p>

<p>“<i>Habet!</i>” With a wild laugh, Frontin pointed to Standing
Bull. The old chief quietly fell forward, with the
point of an arrow emerging from his back, and was dead.
“Seven of us left in all, cap’n. Hurt?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then I am. Come and cut out this shaft.”</p>

<p>Startled, Crawford sprang to Frontin’s side and saw
that his friend was pierced through, below the right shoulder.
With his knife, he slashed at the crimsoned arrowhead;
Frontin gripped the feathered shaft and drew it out.
At this instant the voice of Maclish roared up from among
the trees of the sacred grove.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>“Ahoy, Crawford! Art there yet?”</p>

<p>“Aye, Maclish,” returned Crawford. “Come out and
settle it with me, you devil!”</p>

<p>“Not I.” Maclish laughed jeeringly. “We’re going to
burn two of your men to-night. With sunrise we’ll finish
it. Tell the Star Woman that I’ll take her in the morning!”</p>

<p>Silence fell. Frontin grinned and put the message into
French for the redskins, while Crawford tied up his
wound.</p>

<p>“We have a respite until morning, cap’n! And well
earned and dear bought, say I. He’s got two of our
wounded men and will burn them to hearten his devils.
Well, this time to-morrow night we’ll be burning too.”</p>

<p>In the last lingering light, two of the wounded warriors
built up a last forlorn signal smoke; but from the silent
forests across the lake, now purpling in the twilight, came
no response, and the horizon was bare. The darkness fell.
Behind the barricade now remained Crawford, Frontin,
Black Kettle and four Dacotah braves. They had a little
water, not much; this was saved for the Star Woman.
Crawford took it to her with a scrap of food, as she lay
beneath the crooked tree. She had just wakened, and her
voice in the darkness thrilled him.</p>

<p>“Let the food wait. I have summoned Metaminens,
called him; he is coming now. When the sun lifts over
the east, he will come.”</p>

<p>“And except that two men are burning, we would be
gone,” thought Crawford, but did not voice his thought.
Nor did he seek any explanation of how she could summon
Metaminens; there was in this girl more of mystery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
than he could fathom—and in the touch of her hand
more of allure than he dared admit.</p>

<p>So as he sat beside her in the night, they talked a little
space of the mother that she had lost; and Crawford spoke
of the Irish girl whom he once had loved, and the name of
Metaminens arose between them.</p>

<p>“He will be here at sunrise, and I shall see him!” said
the Star Woman, and sighed. And at this Crawford
leaned over and touched his lips to her forehead, and so
left her. The Dacotah came and built up a little shelter
of pine boughs above her, and she slept.</p>

<p>To the little group of wounded and desperate men who
waited there by the crooked tree, the dark hours drew on
terribly. From the sacred grove gleamed the lurid glow
of fires, while the fierce laughter of the Stone Men told
of the grim work going on there; and once the sharp
scream of a man in mortal agony came wrenching through
the darkness, but only once. Then, after midnight, silence
fell, and Crawford slept a little.</p>

<p>In the rustling greyness of dawn, when mist-shadows
were stealing up from the lake and the contorted shape of
the sacred pine hung black against the paling sky, Crawford
was wakened by Black Kettle.</p>

<p>“My brother, it is time. The Star Woman is awake,
also.”</p>

<p>Crawford rose, shook himself, went to the little shelter
of boughs.</p>

<p>“It is certain,” said the Star Woman quietly, looking up
at him. “When the sun lifts, Metaminens will be here.
Tell the others.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>Crawford told them, but they only grunted; those redskins
had no illusions now.</p>

<p>The dawn increased, and up the eastern sky pierced the
first reddened lance-tips of the day. Black Kettle divided
with the four Dacotah the remaining arrows, and waited.
Frontin and Crawford smoked. From the sacred grove
beyond the breastwork arose a murmur of voices, among
them lifting the deep tones of Maclish. One of the Dacotah,
listening, uttered a curt laugh and translated.</p>

<p>“They say the Red Bull is a coward; they will not attack
unless he leads them.”</p>

<p>As though in response, a burst of yells lifted from the
trees.</p>

<p>“Coming!” said Frontin, and knocked out his pipe.</p>

<p>The seven ranged themselves behind the fallen trees,
arrows on string, long war-clubs ready, tomahawk and
knife at belt; Crawford stood in the centre, Frontin and
the Mohegan to either side of him. The pealing whoop
of Black Kettle made fierce answer to the yells, and then
across the opening came a rush of dark figures.</p>

<p>Now the Dacotah bows thrummed and sang for the last
time, and the biting shafts flew fast; no arrows made answer,
for Maclish wanted to take the Star Woman alive.
The eastern sky was all aflame with scarlet and gold, and
full day was breaking. Stumbling across their dead, the
Stone Men flooded onto the breastwork, crashed amid the
boughs, and came storming over it. And at their head,
hurling himself madly forward, was Maclish, axe in hand.</p>

<p>Crawford waited, crouching, laughing softly to himself.
He did not move as the burly Scot smashed into the tangle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
of tree-limbs, until he saw that red-bearded animal’s face
lift into sight not three feet from him—then, rising suddenly,
he flung himself out and grappled his enemy.</p>

<p>It was axe to axe, fist to fist, man to man, while about
them the tide of battle rolled unheeded and unheeding.
Crawford flashed his axe, felt it torn from his hand, and
whipped out his knife. Steel was biting him, but he felt
it not. He bore the Scot backward, laughed into the contorted
face, drove home his knife again and again until
he was amazed to find that his work was done. Before
the wild ferocity of the attack, Maclish crumpled up and
gasped, and died cursing.</p>

<p>Scarce realizing the fact, Crawford scrambled back
across the barrier and stood to wipe the blood from his
face. Then he went staggering under the knife-thrust of
an Assiniboine who struck him from behind, following the
blow with a leap. Crawford met the leap with his knife,
dashed the warrior aside, and stood reeling. The last
Dacotah was down, still struggling under a heap of bodies,
while Frontin and Black Kettle fought their way toward
the crooked tree at the point of the cliff.</p>

<p>Black Kettle gave his death-yell to the crashing impact
of a war-club, and vanished. Then Crawford, forgotten,
picked up a fallen club and rushed into the thick of the
mêlée. He reached Frontin, struck aside a leaping warrior,
and together they reached the crooked tree beside
the little shelter where the Star Woman lay. There
against the twisted pine they stood back to back, while the
Stone Men surged in upon them and drew away again,
awed by the dark man who laughed as he wielded crimsoned
knife, and the other man with blazing eyes and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
great star shimmering at his throat as the club swung.
Awed for a moment only—then they closed in.</p>

<p>Knife bit delicately, with the deadly precision of a
rapier; club thudded and crashed; men died and lay broken,
ringing in the pair who fought. The flood surged in
again and again, only to be beaten back, shattered, hurled
aside from that ring of dead. In again it came, relentless
and maddened. Frontin, staggering under a smashing
blow, went to his knees, reeled back gasping against the
tree-bole. Crawford swung his weapon, but blood was on
his hand and it slipped away. He dragged at his knife,
drove out with it again and again at the rimming circle
of faces—and for the last time that flood drew back.
Frontin staggered up.</p>

<p>“Can ye see Phelim Burke now?” he croaked, with a
ghastly laugh.</p>

<p>A vibrant note made answer and Frontin lay back
against the crooked tree, pinned to it by a shaft whose
feathered end stood out of his breast. A stone axe hurtled
in air, and Crawford staggered. He threw out his hands
and fell forward, and lay across the little arbour of the
Star Woman, who caught him in her arms as he fell.</p>

<p>Then the sun rose, and Metaminens came.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

WHEN A STAR FALLS, A SOUL HAS PASSED</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sieur Nicholas Perrot</span> came along, making
his way among the strewn bodies, to the crooked
tree; he wavered a little as he came, for weakness
was still heavy upon him. No other was in sight, but
from the depths of the forest around came the stabbing
reports of guns, the yells of men, the fierce war-cry of the
Dacotah warriors, rolling afar in a gradually lessening
rout of receding slaughter. None of the Stone Men would
return to their own villages from the lake of many stars,
and from this day forward the enmity between Dacotah
and Assiniboine would never die down. So the dream of
Sieur Perrot had ended, after all, in failure.</p>

<p>Perrot came to a sudden halt, aghast at what he beheld
and heard. Of the Star Woman he could see nothing, for
she lay unconscious beneath Crawford’s body. But there
in the morning sunlight stood Frontin, bleeding from a
dozen wounds; having torn himself from the shaft that
pinned him to the tree, Frontin leaned on a broken musket,
laughing horribly at Perrot. Now, lowering an almost useless
hand, Frontin stooped and picked up an object that
lay beside the silent figure of Crawford. It was the Star
of Dreams.</p>

<p>“Dead!” said Frontin thinly. “Dead!”</p>

<p>Perrot crossed himself and tried to speak, but could not.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
With a shuffling step, Frontin came to the verge of the
cliff and swayed a little, the musket escaping from his
grip. The man was dying where he stood, and Sieur Perrot
was frozen by the sight.</p>

<p>“Well, M. Crawford was right!” Faint as was the
voice, it was Frontin’s old cool, sardonic tone. “He followed
the Star of Dreams—and it led him across the horizon
to which all men must attain. Yes, he was right; he
alone has won this game! If you will regard the smile
on his lips, my dear Perrot, you will see that he is happy.
I think you are Sieur Perrot? Of course.”</p>

<p>An inarticulate word escaped the older man, then he
checked himself. Frontin held up the Star of Dreams, so
that the level morning sunlight striking across the far
forest leagues below drew from it a shimmer of flame.
He swayed suddenly, then caught himself.</p>

<p>“Ah, my captain, my captain!” he said mournfully.
“What was it—an agent of unseen destiny? <i>Eh, bien!</i>
You played the game, you won your fight. Fall, my star,
fall! When a star falls, they say, a soul has passed——”</p>

<p>Frontin jerked his hand. The jewel flew out into the
air, blazed for an instant with a swift sheen of green and
gold, then was gone with a long flash to the lake below.
Frontin staggered for the second time, and looked sideways
at Perrot.</p>

<p>“My dear Sieur Perrot,” and his words were little more
than a whisper, “when you go to court, and they ask
whether you have encountered M. le Marquis de Sazerac
in the New World, you may say to them that—he followed—the
Star of—Dreams——”</p>

<p>His knees were loosened, and he suddenly pitched forward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
and was gone from sight. The echo of his wild
laugh floated up from the depth, and that was all.</p>

<p>Sieur Nicholas Perrot clutched the crucifix at his breast,
and closed his eyes, trembling. His lips moved silently.—then
he suddenly lifted his head and looked up. A
sound came to his ears. He started violently.</p>

<p>“Metaminens!”</p>

<p>Now, suddenly seeing what he had failed to see, Perrot
threw himself forward and a cry broke from his lips. He
hurled the brush aside, and met the gaze of the Star
Woman. Eyes distended, he caught her hand, stared at
her, babbled frightened words.</p>

<p>“You—you—ah, it is not you at all!” he exclaimed incoherently.</p>

<p>The Star Woman sat up. With one arm she held the
body of Crawford, which lay across her knees, the other
hand she extended to Perrot.</p>

<p>“Metaminens!” A glory was in her eyes. “It is you!
Here, look to him quickly—he is not dead—I can feel his
heart beating——”</p>

<p>Perrot awoke to action. He turned Crawford over and
swiftly examined the hurt body.</p>

<p>“No—he is not dead. He will not die if——”</p>

<p>His eyes fell upon the star of silver and turquoise that
hung across the bandaged breast of the Star Woman. A
deathly pallor came into his face. He reached out and
touched the star.</p>

<p>“You—yes, it is you after all——”</p>

<p>“Look to him, quickly!” cried the girl, and then fell
back, her eyes closed.</p>

<p>Perrot glanced at Crawford and shrugged. “You are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
far from death, my friend,” he murmured. Leaning forward,
he touched the breast of the girl, nodded reassuringly
as he felt her heartbeat, then looked for a long moment
into her quiet face.</p>

<p>When he rose and stood erect, the grey-bearded cheeks
of Sieur Nicholas Perrot were sparkling with tears. In his
eyes lay a great wonder, and a greater heartache.</p>

<p>“Her daughter—her daughter!” he said softly. “And
I never knew! Now I have come too late—she will never
know, and how can I tell her? Metaminens is no more—his
work is done, his heart is broken and dead, his body
is outworn, his spirit is weary. Oh, Star Woman, you
who have gone across the horizon—wait for me! Your
daughter has found her destiny in this man—leave the
future to them, and wait for me, Star Woman! I shall
not be long in coming to you. Not what has been, my
Star Woman, but what will be—what will be——”</p>

<p>So Perrot stood there, with bowed head, until Crawford
groaned and stirred. Then, brushing the tears from his
grey beard, Sieur Nicholas Perrot knelt to his work. And
above him the morning breeze lifted the singing pine-needles
of the crooked tree, as though up there a voice
whispered back to him——</p>

<p>“What will be!”</p>
